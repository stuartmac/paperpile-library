                 seeds from germinating under unfavorable environmental
                 conditions. ABA HYPERSENSITIVE GERMINATION1 (AHG1) encoding a
                 type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C) is a central negative
                 regulator of ABA response in germination; however, the
                 molecular function and regulation of AHG1 remain elusive. Here
                 we report that AHG1 interacts with DELAY OF GERMINATION1
                 (DOG1), which is a pivotal positive regulator in seed dormancy.
                 DOG1 acts upstream of AHG1 and impairs the PP2C activity of
                 AHG1 in vitro. Furthermore, DOG1 has the ability to bind heme.
                 Binding of DOG1 to AHG1 and heme are independent processes, but
                 both are essential for DOG1 function in vivo. Our study
                 demonstrates that AHG1 and DOG1 constitute an important

              in the population. Identifying and ascertaining the frequency of
              such rare variants requires very large sample sizes. Here, we
              present the largest catalog of human protein-coding variation to
              date, derived from exome sequencing of 985,830 individuals of
              diverse ancestry to serve as a rich resource for studying rare
              coding variants. Individuals of African, Admixed American, East
              Asian, Middle Eastern, and South Asian ancestry account for 20\%
              of this Exome dataset. Our catalog of variants includes
              approximately 10.5 million missense (54\% novel) and 1.1 million
              predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) variants (65\% novel, 53\%
              observed only once). We identified individuals with rare
              homozygous pLOF variants in 4,874 genes, and for 1,838 of these
              this work is the first to document at least one pLOF homozygote.
              Additional insights from the RGC-ME dataset include 1) improved
              estimates of selection against heterozygous loss-of-function and
              identification of 3,459 genes intolerant to loss-of-function, 83
              of which were previously assessed as tolerant to loss-of-function
              and 1,241 that lack disease annotations; 2) identification of
              regions depleted of missense variation in 457 genes that are
              tolerant to loss-of-function; 3) functional interpretation for
              10,708 variants of unknown or conflicting significance reported in
              ClinVar as cryptic splice sites using splicing score thresholds
              based on empirical variant deleteriousness scores derived from
              RGC-ME; and 4) an observation that approximately 3\% of sequenced
              individuals carry a clinically actionable genetic variant in the
              ACMG SF 3.1 list of genes. We make this important resource of
              coding variation available to the public through a variant allele

  abstract  = "? Abstract?Polymorphism, or variation within species, is common
               in all kinds of data and is the major focus of research on
               microevolution. However, polymorphism is often ignored by those
               who study macroevolution: systematists and comparative
               evolutionary biologists. Polymorphism may have a profound impact
               on phylogeny reconstruction, species-delimitation, and studies of
               character evolution. A variety of methods are used to deal with
               polymorphism in phylogeny reconstruction, and many of these
               methods have been extremely controversial for more than 20 years.
               Recent research has attempted to address the accuracy of these
               methods (their ability to estimate the true phylogeny) and to
               resolve these issues, using computer simulation, congruence, and
               statistical analyses. These studies suggest three things: that
               (a) the exclusion of polymorphic characters (as is commonly done
               in morphological phylogenetics) is unjustified and may greatly
               decrease accuracy relative to analyses that include these
               characters; (b) methods that incorporate frequency information on
               polymorphic characters tend to perform best, and (c) distance and
               likelihood methods designed for polymorphic data may often
               outperform parsimony methods. Although rarely discussed,
               polymorphism may also have a major impact on comparative studies
               of character evolution, such as the reconstruction of ancestral
               character states. Finally, polymorphism is an important issue in
               the delimitation of species, although this area has been somewhat
               neglected methodologically. The integration of within-species
               variation and microevolutionary processes into studies of
               systematics and comparative evolutionary biology is another
               example of the benefits of exchange of ideas between the fields
               of population genetics and systematics.",

                 receptors, CAR is constitutively active. Here, we report the
                 heterodimeric structure of the CAR and RXR ligand binding
                 domains (LBDs), which reveals an unusually large dimerization
                 interface and a small CAR ligand binding pocket. Constitutive
                 CAR activity appears to be mediated by the compact nature of
                 the CAR LBD that displays several unique features including a
                 shortened AF2 helix and helix H10, which are linked by a
                 two-turn helix that normally adopts an extended loop in other

                 disease-related genes would have a marked effect on clinical
                 decisions, yet the overwhelming majority (over 98\%) of these
                 variants still have unknown consequences1-3. In principle,
                 computational methods could support the large-scale
                 interpretation of genetic variants. However, state-of-the-art
                 methods4-10 have relied on training machine learning models on
                 known disease labels. As these labels are sparse, biased and of
                 variable quality, the resulting models have been considered
                 insufficiently reliable11. Here we propose an approach that
                 leverages deep generative models to predict variant
                 pathogenicity without relying on labels. By modelling the
                 distribution of sequence variation across organisms, we
                 implicitly capture constraints on the protein sequences that
                 maintain fitness. Our model EVE (evolutionary model of variant
                 effect) not only outperforms computational approaches that rely
                 on labelled data but also performs on par with, if not better
                 than, predictions from high-throughput experiments, which are
                 increasingly used as evidence for variant classification12-16.
                 We predict the pathogenicity of more than 36 million variants
                 across 3,219 disease genes and provide evidence for the
                 classification of more than 256,000 variants of unknown
                 significance. Our work suggests that models of evolutionary
                 information can provide valuable independent evidence for

                 We hypothesize that the constraint on missense variation at
                 individual amino acid sites is largely shaped by direct
                 interactions with 3D neighboring sites. To quantify this
                 constraint, we introduce a framework called COntact Set
                 MISsense tolerance (or COSMIS) and comprehensively map the
                 landscape of 3D mutational constraint on 6.1 million amino acid
                 sites covering 16,533 human proteins. We show that 3D
                 mutational constraint is pervasive and that the level of
                 constraint is strongly associated with disease relevance both
                 at the site and the protein level. We demonstrate that COSMIS
                 performs significantly better at variant interpretation tasks

                 providing structural insight into the functional roles of

  abstract    = "People with schizophrenia are enriched for rare coding variants
                 in genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders,
                 particularly autism spectrum disorders and intellectual
                 disability. However, it is unclear if the same changes to gene
                 function that increase risk to neurodevelopmental disorders
                 also do so for schizophrenia. Using data from 3444
                 schizophrenia trios and 37,488 neurodevelopmental disorder
                 trios, we show that within shared risk genes, de novo variants
                 in schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders are generally
                 of the same functional category, and that specific de novo
                 variants observed in neurodevelopmental disorders are enriched
                 in schizophrenia (P = 5.0 × 10-6). The latter includes variants
                 known to be pathogenic for syndromic disorders, suggesting that
                 schizophrenia be included as a characteristic of those
                 syndromes. Our findings imply that, in part, neurodevelopmental
                 disorders and schizophrenia have shared molecular aetiology,
                 and therefore likely overlapping pathophysiology, and support
                 the hypothesis that at least some forms of schizophrenia lie on
                 a continuum of neurodevelopmental disorders.",

                 connections between gene function and disease pathogenesis. By
                 meta-analysing the whole exomes of 24,248 schizophrenia cases
                 and 97,322 controls, we implicate ultra-rare coding variants
                 (URVs) in 10 genes as conferring substantial risk for
                 schizophrenia (odds ratios of 3-50, P < 2.14 × 10-6) and 32
                 genes at a false discovery rate of <5\%. These genes have the
                 greatest expression in central nervous system neurons and have
                 diverse molecular functions that include the formation,
                 structure and function of the synapse. The associations of the
                 NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor subunit GRIN2A and AMPA
                 (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)
                 receptor subunit GRIA3 provide support for dysfunction of the
                 glutamatergic system as a mechanistic hypothesis in the
                 pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We observe an overlap of rare
                 variant risk among schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders1,
                 epilepsy and severe neurodevelopmental disorders2, although
                 different mutation types are implicated in some shared genes.
                 Most genes described here, however, are not implicated in
                 neurodevelopment. We demonstrate that genes prioritized from
                 common variant analyses of schizophrenia are enriched in rare
                 variant risk3, suggesting that common and rare genetic risk
                 factors converge at least partially on the same underlying
                 pathogenic biological processes. Even after excluding
                 significantly associated genes, schizophrenia cases still carry
                 a substantial excess of URVs, which indicates that more risk
                 genes await discovery using this approach.",

  abstract    = "Genome-wide association studies using large-scale genome and
                 exome sequencing data have become increasingly valuable in
                 identifying associations between genetic variants and disease,
                 transforming basic research and translational medicine.
                 However, this progress has not been equally shared across all
                 people and conditions, in part due to limited resources.
                 Leveraging publicly available sequencing data as external
                 common controls, rather than sequencing new controls for every
                 study, can better allocate resources by augmenting control
                 sample sizes or providing controls where none existed. However,
                 common control studies must be carefully planned and executed
                 as even small differences in sample ascertainment and
                 processing can result in substantial bias. Here, we discuss
                 challenges and opportunities for the robust use of common
                 controls in high-throughput sequencing studies, including study
                 design, quality control and statistical approaches. Thoughtful
                 generation and use of large and valuable genetic sequencing
                 data sets will enable investigation of a broader and more
                 representative set of conditions, environments and genetic
                 ancestries than otherwise possible.",

                 in order to investigate in parallel, the enrichment of common
                 and (ultra-)rare variants related to schizophrenia in several
                 functionally relevant gene-sets. Four types of gene-sets were
                 constructed 1) protein-truncating variant (PTV)-intolerant (PI)
                 genes 2) genes expressed in brain cell types and neurons
                 ascertained from mouse and human brain tissue 3) genes defined
                 by synaptic function and location and 4) intersection genes,
                 i.e., PI genes that are expressed in the human and mouse brain
                 cell gene-sets. We show that common as well as ultra-rare

                 synaptic processes. We also observed stronger enrichment in the
                 intersection genes. Our findings suggest that across the allele
                 frequency spectrum, genes and genetic variants likely to be
                 under stringent selection, and those expressed in particular
                 brain cell types, are involved in the same biological pathways

  abstract    = "Schizophrenia has a heritability of 60-80\%1, much of which is
                 attributable to common risk alleles. Here, in a two-stage
                 genome-wide association study of up to 76,755 individuals with
                 schizophrenia and 243,649 control individuals, we report common
                 variant associations at 287 distinct genomic loci. Associations
                 were concentrated in genes that are expressed in excitatory and
                 inhibitory neurons of the central nervous system, but not in
                 other tissues or cell types. Using fine-mapping and functional
                 genomic data, we identify 120 genes (106 protein-coding) that
                 are likely to underpin associations at some of these loci,
                 including 16 genes with credible causal non-synonymous or
                 untranslated region variation. We also implicate fundamental
                 processes related to neuronal function, including synaptic
                 organization, differentiation and transmission. Fine-mapped
                 candidates were enriched for genes associated with rare
                 disruptive coding variants in people with schizophrenia,
                 including the glutamate receptor subunit GRIN2A and
                 transcription factor SP4, and were also enriched for genes
                 implicated by such variants in neurodevelopmental disorders. We
                 identify biological processes relevant to schizophrenia
                 pathophysiology; show convergence of common and rare variant
                 associations in schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders;
                 and provide a resource of prioritized genes and variants to

  abstract    = "More than a hundred genes have been identified that, when
                 disrupted, impart large risk for autism spectrum disorder
                 (ASD). Current knowledge about the encoded proteins - although
                 incomplete - points to a very wide range of developmentally
                 dynamic and diverse biological processes. Moreover, the core
                 symptoms of ASD involve distinctly human characteristics,
                 presenting challenges to interpreting evolutionarily distant
                 model systems. Indeed, despite a decade of striking progress in
                 gene discovery, an actionable understanding of pathobiology
                 remains elusive. Increasingly, convergent neuroscience
                 approaches have been recognized as an important complement to
                 traditional uses of genetics to illuminate the biology of human
                 disorders. These methods seek to identify intersection among
                 molecular-level, cellular-level and circuit-level functions
                 across multiple risk genes and have highlighted developing
                 excitatory neurons in the human mid-gestational prefrontal
                 cortex as an important pathobiological nexus in ASD. In
                 addition, neurogenesis, chromatin modification and synaptic
                 function have emerged as key potential mediators of genetic
                 vulnerability. The continued expansion of foundational 'omics'
                 data sets, the application of higher-throughput model systems
                 and incorporating developmental trajectories and sex
                 differences into future analyses will refine and extend these
                 results. Ultimately, a systems-level understanding of ASD
                 genetic risk holds promise for clarifying pathobiology and
                 advancing therapeutics.",

                 but their impact in schizophrenia is unclear. Here we analyzed
                 genome sequences of adults with schizophrenia and found that
                 they have a higher burden of TREs that are near exons and rare
                 in the general population, compared with non-psychiatric

                 to be associated with schizophrenia from genome-wide
                 association studies, in individuals with clinically-relevant
                 genetic variants at other schizophrenia loci, and in families
                 where multiple individuals have schizophrenia. We showed that
                 rare TREs in schizophrenia may impact synaptic functions by
                 disrupting the splicing process of their associated genes in a
                 loss-of-function manner. Our findings support the involvement

                 across human tissues with age, including in the haematopoietic
                 system, where the phenomenon is termed clonal
                 haematopoiesis1-4. The understanding of how and when clonal
                 haematopoiesis develops, the factors that govern its behaviour,
                 how it interacts with ageing and how these variables relate to
                 malignant progression remains limited5,6. Here we track 697
                 clonal haematopoiesis clones from 385 individuals 55 years of
                 age or older over a median of 13 years. We find that 92.4\% of
                 clones expanded at a stable exponential rate over the study
                 period, with different mutations driving substantially
                 different growth rates, ranging from 5\% (DNMT3A and TP53) to
                 more than 50\% per year (SRSF2P95H). Growth rates of clones
                 with the same mutation differed by approximately ±5\% per year,
                 proportionately affecting slow drivers more substantially. By
                 combining our time-series data with phylogenetic analysis of
                 1,731 whole-genome sequences of haematopoietic colonies from 7
                 individuals from an older age group, we reveal distinct
                 patterns of lifelong clonal behaviour. DNMT3A-mutant clones
                 preferentially expanded early in life and displayed slower
                 growth in old age, in the context of an increasingly
                 competitive oligoclonal landscape. By contrast, splicing gene
                 mutations drove expansion only later in life, whereas
                 TET2-mutant clones emerged across all ages. Finally, we show
                 that mutations driving faster clonal growth carry a higher risk
                 of malignant progression. Our findings characterize the
                 lifelong natural history of clonal haematopoiesis and give

                 regenerative capacity1, cytopenias2, immune dysfunction3 and
                 increased risk of blood cancer4-6, but the reason for such
                 abrupt functional decline after 70 years of age remains
                 unclear. Here we sequenced 3,579 genomes from single
                 cell-derived colonies of haematopoietic cells across 10 human
                 subjects from 0 to 81 years of age. Haematopoietic stem cells
                 or multipotent progenitors (HSC/MPPs) accumulated a mean of 17
                 mutations per year after birth and lost 30 base pairs per year
                 of telomere length. Haematopoiesis in adults less than 65 years
                 of age was massively polyclonal, with high clonal diversity and
                 a stable population of 20,000-200,000 HSC/MPPs contributing
                 evenly to blood production. By contrast, haematopoiesis in
                 individuals aged over 75 showed profoundly decreased clonal
                 diversity. In each of the older subjects, 30-60\% of
                 haematopoiesis was accounted for by 12-18 independent clones,
                 each contributing 1-34\% of blood production. Most clones had
                 begun their expansion before the subject was 40 years old, but
                 only 22\% had known driver mutations. Genome-wide selection
                 analysis estimated that between 1 in 34 and 1 in 12
                 non-synonymous mutations were drivers, accruing at constant
                 rates throughout life, affecting more genes than identified in
                 blood cancers. Loss of the Y chromosome conferred selective
                 benefits in males. Simulations of haematopoiesis, with constant
                 stem cell population size and constant acquisition of driver
                 mutations conferring moderate fitness benefits, entirely
                 explained the abrupt change in clonal structure in the elderly.
                 Rapidly decreasing clonal diversity is a universal feature of
                 haematopoiesis in aged humans, underpinned by pervasive
                 positive selection acting on many more genes than currently

                 with dozens of sequence variants accounting for over 30\% of
                 the protein in an animal body. The fibrillar and hierarchical
                 arrangements of collagen are critical in providing mechanical
                 properties with high strength and toughness. Due to this
                 ubiquitous role in human tissues, collagen-based biomaterials
                 are commonly used for tissue repairs and regeneration,
                 requiring chemical and thermal stability over a range of
                 temperatures during materials preparation ex vivo and
                 subsequent utility in vivo. Collagen unfolds from a triple
                 helix to a random coil structure during a temperature interval
                 in which the midpoint or Tm is used as a measure to evaluate
                 the thermal stability of the molecules. However, finding a
                 robust framework to facilitate the design of a specific
                 collagen sequence to yield a specific Tm remains a challenge,
                 including using conventional molecular dynamics modeling. Here
                 we propose a de novo framework to provide a model that outputs
                 the Tm values of input collagen sequences by incorporating deep
                 learning trained on a large data set of collagen sequences and
                 corresponding Tm values. By using this framework, we are able
                 to quickly evaluate how mutations and order in the primary
                 sequence affect the stability of collagen triple helices.

               fundamental information on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
               and allosteric modulation, presenting original research in the
               area and collectively providing a comprehensive description of
               key issues in GPCR allosteric modulation. The book provides
               background on core concepts of molecular pharmacology while also
               introducing the most important advances and studies in the area.
               It also discusses key methodologies. This is an essential book
               for researchers and advanced students engaged in pharmacology,
               toxicology and pharmaceutical sciences training and research.
               Many of the GPCR-targeted drugs released in the past decade have
               specifically worked via allosteric mechanisms. Unlike direct
               orthosteric-acting compounds that occupy a similar receptor site
               to that of endogenous ligands, allosteric modulators alter
               GPCR-dependent signaling at a site apart from the endogenous
               ligand. Recent methodological and analytical advances have
               greatly improved our ability to understand the signaling
               mechanisms of GPCRs. We now know that allostery is a common
               regulatory mechanism for all GPCRs and not – as we once believed
               – unique to a few receptor subfamilies. Introduces background on
               core concepts of molecular pharmacology, including statistical
               analyses, non-linear regression, complex models and
               GPCR-dependent signal transduction as they relate to allosteric
               modulation Discusses critical advances and landmark studies,
               including discoveries in the area of GPCR allosteric modulation,
               which are reviewed for their importance in positive and negative
               regulation, protein-protein interactions, and small molecule drug
               discovery Includes key methodologies used to study allosteric

               activities. Allostery can both cause human diseases and
               contribute to development of new therapeutics. Allosteric drugs
               exhibit unparalleled advantages compared to conventional

                 The extent to which this variation is functional and the
                 mechanisms by which they exert their influence remains largely
                 unexplored. To address this gap, we leverage the ExAC database
                 of 60,706 human exomes to investigate experimentally the impact
                 of 2009 missense single nucleotide variants (SNVs) across 2185
                 protein-protein interactions, generating interaction profiles
                 for 4797 SNV-interaction pairs, of which 421 SNVs segregate at
                 > 1\% allele frequency in human populations. We find that
                 interaction-disruptive SNVs are prevalent at both rare and
                 common allele frequencies. Furthermore, these results suggest
                 that 10.5\% of missense variants carried per individual are
                 disruptive, a higher proportion than previously reported; this
                 indicates that each individual's genetic makeup may be

                 nervous system (PNS) and contribute to fast saltatory
                 conduction via the formation of compact myelin, in which water
                 is excluded from between tightly adhered lipid bilayers.
                 Peripheral neuropathies, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
                 (CMT) and Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS), are incurable
                 demyelinating conditions that result in pain, decrease in
                 muscle mass, and functional impairment. Many Schwann cell
                 proteins, which are directly involved in the stability of
                 compact myelin or its development, are subject to mutations
                 linked to these neuropathies. The most abundant PNS myelin
                 protein is protein zero (P0); point mutations in this
                 transmembrane protein cause CMT subtype 1B and DSS. P0 tethers
                 apposing lipid bilayers together through its extracellular
                 immunoglobulin-like domain. Additionally, P0 contains a
                 cytoplasmic tail (P0ct), which is membrane-associated and
                 contributes to the physical properties of the lipid membrane.
                 Six CMT- and DSS-associated missense mutations have been
                 reported in P0ct. We generated recombinant disease mutant
                 variants of P0ct and characterized them using biophysical
                 methods. Compared to wild-type P0ct, some mutants have
                 negligible differences in function and folding, while others
                 highlight functionally important amino acids within P0ct. For
                 example, the D224Y variant of P0ct induced tight membrane
                 multilayer stacking. Our results show a putative molecular
                 basis for the hypermyelinating phenotype observed in patients
                 with this particular mutation and provide overall information
                 on the effects of disease-linked mutations in a flexible,
                 membrane-binding protein segment. Using neutron reflectometry,
                 we additionally show that P0ct embeds deep into a lipid
                 bilayer, explaining the observed effects of P0ct on the
                 physical properties of the membrane.",

                 sequencing has resulted in many new diagnoses for rare genetic
                 conditions, but testing regularly identifies variants of
                 uncertain significance (VUS). The remarkable rise in the amount
                 of genomic data has been paralleled by a rise in the number of
                 protein structures that are now publicly available, which may
                 have clinical utility for the interpretation of missense and
                 in-frame insertions or deletions. METHODS: Within a UK National
                 Health Service genomic medicine diagnostic laboratory, we
                 investigated the number of VUS over a 5-year period that were
                 evaluated using protein structural analysis and how often this
                 analysis aided variant classification. RESULTS: We found 99
                 novel missense and in-frame variants across 67 genes that were
                 initially classified as VUS by our diagnostic laboratory using
                 standard variant classification guidelines and for which
                 further analysis of protein structure was requested. Evidence
                 from protein structural analysis was used in the re-assessment
                 of 64 variants, of which 47 were subsequently reclassified as
                 pathogenic or likely pathogenic and 17 remained as VUS. We
                 identified several case studies where protein structural
                 analysis aided variant interpretation by predicting disease
                 mechanisms that were consistent with the observed phenotypes,
                 including loss-of-function through thermodynamic
                 destabilisation or disruption of ligand binding, and
                 gain-of-function through de-repression or escape from
                 proteasomal degradation. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that using
                 in silico protein structural analysis can aid classification of
                 VUS and give insights into the mechanisms of pathogenicity.
                 Based on our experience, we propose a generic evidence-based
                 workflow for incorporating protein structural information into
                 diagnostic practice to facilitate variant classification.",

                 involved in drug disposition have been extensively studied,
                 drug target variability remains underappreciated. By mapping
                 the genomic variability of all human drug target genes onto
                 high-resolution crystal structures of drug target complexes, we

                 model that can accurately infer protein structure from
                 sequence-may discern important features of folded protein
                 energy landscapes, defined by the diversity and frequency of
                 different conformations in the folded state. Here, we test the
                 limits of its predictive power on fold-switching proteins,
                 which assume two structures with regions of distinct secondary
                 and/or tertiary structure. We find that (1) AF is a weak
                 predictor of fold switching and (2) some of its successes
                 result from memorization of training-set structures rather than
                 learned protein energetics. Combining >280,000 models from
                 several implementations of AF2 and AF3, a 35\% success rate was
                 achieved for fold switchers likely in AF's training sets. AF2's
                 confidence metrics selected against models consistent with
                 experimentally determined fold-switching structures and failed
                 to discriminate between low and high energy conformations.
                 Further, AF captured only one out of seven experimentally
                 confirmed fold switchers outside of its training sets despite
                 extensive sampling of an additional ~280,000 models. Several
                 observations indicate that AF2 has memorized structural
                 information during training, and AF3 misassigns coevolutionary
                 restraints. These limitations constrain the scope of successful
                 predictions, highlighting the need for physically based methods
                 that readily predict multiple protein conformations.",

                 to predict protein structures with exceptionally high accuracy.
                 Its implementation, however, lacks the code and data required
                 to train new models. These are necessary to (1) tackle new
                 tasks, like protein-ligand complex structure prediction, (2)
                 investigate the process by which the model learns and (3)
                 assess the model's capacity to generalize to unseen regions of
                 fold space. Here we report OpenFold, a fast, memory efficient
                 and trainable implementation of AlphaFold2. We train OpenFold
                 from scratch, matching the accuracy of AlphaFold2. Having
                 established parity, we find that OpenFold is remarkably robust
                 at generalizing even when the size and diversity of its
                 training set is deliberately limited, including near-complete
                 elisions of classes of secondary structure elements. By
                 analyzing intermediate structures produced during training, we
                 also gain insights into the hierarchical manner in which
                 OpenFold learns to fold. In sum, our studies demonstrate the
                 power and utility of OpenFold, which we believe will prove to

                 structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their
                 function. Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the
                 structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been
                 determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the
                 billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is
                 bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort
                 required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate
                 computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to
                 enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the
                 three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based
                 solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure prediction
                 component of the 'protein folding problem'8-has been an
                 important open research problem for more than 50 years9.
                 Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short
                 of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is
                 available. Here we provide the first computational method that
                 can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy
                 even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We
                 validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural
                 network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th
                 Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15,
                 demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures
                 in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods.
                 Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine
                 learning approach that incorporates physical and biological
                 knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence

              contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across
              proteins and diseases, and is particularly important in recessive
              disorders. Mutational effects on stability are largely conserved

                 mutations is yet to be determined, the genomic data, showing
                 the rapid displacement of other lineages, suggest that this

                 progression from normal to cancer cell and the APOBEC enzymes

                 individuals and found that SBS2/SBS13 mutations were present in

                 Crypts with SBS2/SBS13 often had immediate crypt neighbors
                 without SBS2/SBS13, suggesting that the underlying cause of

                 cases using PCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 739
                 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from November 2019 to March

                 evolutionary and spatial relationships using next generation
                 sequencing (NGS). We observed that the overall incidence of ILI
                 cases during 2019-2020 influenza season was considerably higher
                 than previous years and was gradually replaced with SARS-CoV-2,
                 which indicated a silent transmission among ambulatory
                 patients. Sequencing of representative isolates confirmed
                 independent introductions and silent transmission earlier than

                 substitutions in spike gene (D614G), RdRp (P323L) and NS3

                 patients with mild COVID-19 illness, particularly those without
                 epidemiological link for acquiring the virus, is of utmost

                 interventions. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in ILI cases shows
                 the importance of ILI surveillance systems and warrants its
                 further strengthening to mitigate the ongoing transmission of
                 SARS-CoV-2. The effect of NS3 substitutions on oligomerization

                 coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the etiological agent of the
                 current COVID-19 pandemic, a rapid and massive effort has been
                 made to obtain the genomic sequences of this virus to monitor
                 (in near real time) the phylodynamic and diversity of this new
                 pathogen. However, less attention has been given to the
                 assessment of intra-host diversity. RNA viruses such as
                 SARS-CoV-2 inhabit the host as a population of variants called
                 quasispecies. We studied the quasispecies diversity in four of
                 the main SARS-CoV-2 genes (ORF1a, ORF1b, S and N genes), using
                 a dataset consisting of 210 next-generation sequencing (NGS)
                 samples collected between January and early April of 2020 in
                 the State of Victoria, Australia. We found evidence of
                 quasispecies diversity in 68\% of the samples, 76\% of which
                 was nonsynonymous variants with a higher density in the spike
                 (S) glycoprotein and ORF1a genes. About one-third of the
                 nonsynonymous intra-host variants were shared among the
                 samples, suggesting host-to-host transmission. Quasispecies
                 diversity changed over time. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
                 some of the intra-host single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) were
                 restricted to specific lineages, highlighting their potential
                 importance in the epidemiology of this virus. A greater effort
                 must be made to determine the magnitude of the genetic
                 bottleneck during transmission and the epidemiological and/or
                 evolutionary factors that may play a role in the changes in the

                 rapidly mutating, and its human-to-human transmission rate is
                 increasing. Hence, temporal dissection of their evolutionary
                 dynamics, the nature of variations among different strains, and
                 understanding the single nucleotide polymorphisms in the
                 endemic settings are crucial. Delineating the heterogeneous
                 genomic constellations of this novel virus will help us
                 understand its complex behavior in a particular geographical
                 region. Objective: This is a comprehensive analysis of 95
                 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences available from the Global
                 Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) repository
                 during the first 6 months of 2020 (January through June).
                 Evolutionary dynamics, gene-specific phylogeny, and the
                 emergence of the novel coevolving mutations in 9 structural and
                 nonstructural genes among circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains across
                 12 different Indian states were analyzed. Methods: A total of
                 95 SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences submitted from India were
                 downloaded from the GISAID database. Molecular Evolutionary
                 Genetics Analysis, version X software was used to construct the
                 9 phylogenetic dendrograms based on nucleotide sequences of the
                 SARS-CoV-2 genes. Analyses of the coevolving mutations were
                 done in comparison to the prototype SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan,
                 China. The secondary structure of the RNA-dependent RNA
                 polymerase/nonstructural protein NSP12 was predicted with
                 respect to the novel A97V mutation. Results: Phylogenetic
                 analyses revealed the evolution of ``genome-type clusters'' and
                 adaptive selection of ``L''-type SARS-CoV-2 strains with
                 genetic closeness to the bat severe acute respiratory
                 syndrome-like coronaviruses. These strains were distant to
                 pangolin or Middle East respiratory syndrome-related
                 coronavirus strains. With regard to the novel coevolving
                 mutations, 2 groups have been seen circulating in India at
                 present, the ``major group'' (66/95, 69.4\%) and the ``minor
                 group'' (21/95, 22.1\%) , harboring 4 and 5 coexisting
                 mutations, respectively. The ``major group'' mutations fall in
                 the A2a clade. All the minor group mutations, except 11083G>T
                 (L37F, NSP6 gene), were unique to the Indian isolates.
                 Conclusions: This study highlights the rapidly evolving
                 SARS-CoV-2 virus and the cocirculation of multiple clades and
                 subclades. This comprehensive study is a potential resource for

  abstract    = "Background: COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2, is
                 considered the most threatening respiratory infection in the
                 world, with over 40 million people infected and over 0.934
                 million related deaths reported worldwide. It is speculated
                 that epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 may
                 differ across countries or continents. Genomic comparison of
                 48,635 SARS-CoV-2 genomes has shown that the average number of
                 mutations per sample was 7.23, and most SARS-CoV-2 strains
                 belong to one of 3 clades characterized by geographic and
                 genomic specificity: Europe, Asia, and North America.
                 Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the genomes of
                 SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from Italy, Sweden, and Congo, that
                 is, 3 different countries in the same meridian (longitude) but
                 with different climate conditions, and from Brazil (as an
                 outgroup country), to analyze similarities or differences in
                 patterns of possible evolutionary pressure signatures in their
                 genomes. Methods: We obtained data from the Global Initiative
                 on Sharing All Influenza Data repository by sampling all
                 genomes available on that date. Using HyPhy, we achieved the
                 recombination analysis by genetic algorithm recombination
                 detection method, trimming, removal of the stop codons, and
                 phylogenetic tree and mixed effects model of evolution
                 analyses. We also performed secondary structure prediction
                 analysis for both sequences (mutated and wild-type) and
                 ``disorder'' and ``transmembrane'' analyses of the protein. We
                 analyzed both protein structures with an ab initio approach to
                 predict their ontologies and 3D structures. Results:
                 Evolutionary analysis revealed that codon 9628 is under
                 episodic selective pressure for all SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated
                 from the 4 countries, suggesting it is a key site for virus
                 evolution. Codon 9628 encodes the P0DTD3 (Y14\_SARS2)
                 uncharacterized protein 14. Further investigation showed that
                 the codon mutation was responsible for helical modification in
                 the secondary structure. The codon was positioned in the more
                 ordered region of the gene (41-59) and near to the area acting
                 as the transmembrane (54-67), suggesting its involvement in the
                 attachment phase of the virus. The predicted protein structures
                 of both wild-type and mutated P0DTD3 confirmed the importance
                 of the codon to define the protein structure. Moreover,
                 ontological analysis of the protein emphasized that the
                 mutation enhances the binding probability. Conclusions: Our
                 results suggest that RNA secondary structure may be affected
                 and, consequently, the protein product changes T (threonine) to
                 G (glycine) in position 50 of the protein. This position is
                 located close to the predicted transmembrane region. Mutation
                 analysis revealed that the change from G (glycine) to D
                 (aspartic acid) may confer a new function to the
                 protein-binding activity, which in turn may be responsible for
                 attaching the virus to human eukaryotic cells. These findings
                 can help design in vitro experiments and possibly facilitate a
                 vaccine design and successful antiviral strategies.",

                 characterization of SARS-CoV-2 strains in Hiroshima and its
                 mutation pattern between the first and second waves of the
                 outbreak. METHOD: A total of 55 nasal swab samples from the
                 first wave in Hiroshima and 13 from the second wave were
                 examined quantitatively by RT-qPCR and qualitatively by nested
                 PCR using specific primers. Four samples from each wave
                 underwent next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic tree
                 analysis including controls and all sequences retrieved in
                 Japan from GISAID and GenBank. Subsequently, mutations were
                 examined. RESULTS: Viral load ranged 7.85 × 101-1.42 × 108
                 copies/ml. Of 68 samples, one was Asian type-O, 65 were
                 European type-GR, and 2 were undetectable. Phylogenetic tree
                 analysis indicated that Japan was infected with various Asian
                 strains (L, S, V, O) from January through April. By second week
                 of March, European strains (G, GH, GR) had appeared, and GR
                 strains became predominant after mid-March. The first case in
                 Hiroshima was classified as Asian strain O, and the rest were
                 GR strains. Then, second wave of GR strains appeared
                 independently with 11-15 base mutations. Comparing the first-
                 and second-wave GR strains, mutation rate was 1.17-1.36 × 10-3
                 base substitutions per site per year; in addition, amino acid
                 changes occurred at S1361P and P3371S in ORF1a, A314V in ORF1b,
                 and P151L in N. All seven GR strains were D614G variants with
                 R202K and G203R mutations in N. A single-nucleotide insertion
                 in ORF8 that causes a defect in ORF8 protein was found in one
                 isolate (S66) from the second wave. CONCLUSION: Our findings
                 reveal the evolutionary hierarchy of SARS-CoV-2 in Japan. The
                 predominant D614G variants and a new form of ORF8 deletion in
                 Hiroshima provide the clue for role of viral factor in local

                 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) glycoprotein D614G mutation became the
                 predominant globally circulating variant after its emergence in
                 the early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Studies
                 showed that this mutation results in an open conformation of
                 the S glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and increased
                 angiotensin 1-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding and fusion,
                 which result in an increase in SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and
                 infectivity. Dynamic tracking of SARS-CoV-2 showed that the
                 D614G variant became predominant after emergence in Europe and
                 North America, but not in China. The current absence of
                 selective pressures from antiviral treatment suggests that the
                 driving force for viral evolution could be variations in human
                 population genetics. Results show that ACE2 expression is
                 higher in Asian populations than that in European, North
                 American, and African populations. This supports the idea that
                 lower ACE2 expression is a driving force in the positive
                 selection for the D614G mutation. This study suggests that the
                 dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation during the
                 early-to-mid pandemic is associated with enhanced transmission
                 efficiency in populations with lower ACE2 expression.
                 Understanding the role that human genetic diversity plays in
                 the adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2 may have an important
                 impact on public health and measures to control the pandemic.",

                 causes COVID-19 is mutating and thus has the potential to adapt
                 during the current pandemic. Whether this evolution will lead
                 to changes in the transmission, the duration, or the severity
                 of the disease is not clear. This has led to considerable
                 scientific and media debate, from raising alarms about
                 evolutionary change to dismissing it. Here we review what
                 little is currently known about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and
                 extend existing evolutionary theory to consider how selection
                 might be acting upon the virus during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                 Although there is currently no definitive evidence that
                 SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing further adaptation, continued
                 evidence-based analysis of evolutionary change is important so

                 outbreak, 2,641 cases of COVID-19 led to 1,832 hospital
                 admissions, 207 intensive care admissions and 126 deaths. We
                 aimed to identify the source and number of introductions of
                 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
                 into Scotland using a combined phylogenetic and epidemiological
                 approach. Sequencing of 1,314 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from
                 available patient samples enabled us to estimate that
                 SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to Scotland on at least 283 occasions
                 during February and March 2020. Epidemiological analysis
                 confirmed that early introductions of SARS-CoV-2 originated
                 from mainland Europe (the majority from Italy and Spain). We
                 identified subsequent early outbreaks in the community, within
                 healthcare facilities and at an international conference.
                 Community transmission occurred after 2 March, 3 weeks before
                 control measures were introduced. Earlier travel restrictions
                 or quarantine measures, both locally and internationally, would
                 have reduced the number of COVID-19 cases in Scotland. The risk

              SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor binding motif (RBM) is a highly
              variable region of S, and provide epidemiological, clinical, and
              molecular characterization of a prevalent, sentinel RBM mutation,
              N439K. We demonstrate N439K S protein has enhanced binding

              vitro replication fitness and cause infections with similar

              mutation confers resistance against several neutralizing

                 alignments and compared their distribution with 76,153 missense
                 variants from patients. With this gene-family approach, we
                 identified 465 regions enriched for patient variants spanning
                 41,463 amino acids in 1252 genes. As a comparison, by testing

                 variant enriched regions, involving only 2639 amino acids and
                 215 genes. Next, we selected de novo variants from 6753

                 siblings and observed an 8.33-fold enrichment of patient

                 P-value = 2.72 × 10-11). By using the complete ClinVar variant
                 set, we found that missense variants inside the identified
                 regions are 106-fold more likely to be classified as pathogenic

                 called SARS-CoV-2. The viral spike (S) protein engages the
                 human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to invade
                 host cells with ~10-15-fold higher affinity compared to
                 SARS-CoV S-protein, making it highly infectious. Here, we
                 assessed if ACE2 polymorphisms can alter host susceptibility to
                 SARS-CoV-2 by affecting this interaction. We analyzed over
                 290,000 samples representing >400 population groups from public
                 genomic datasets and identified multiple ACE2 protein-altering
                 variants. Using reported structural data, we identified natural
                 ACE2 variants that could potentially affect virus-host
                 interaction and thereby alter host susceptibility. These
                 include variants S19P, I21V, E23K, K26R, T27A, N64K, T92I,
                 Q102P and H378R that were predicted to increase susceptibility,
                 while variants K31R, N33I, H34R, E35K, E37K, D38V, Y50F, N51S,
                 M62V, K68E, F72V, Y83H, G326E, G352V, D355N, Q388L and D509Y
                 were predicted to be protective variants that show decreased
                 binding to S-protein. Using biochemical assays, we confirmed
                 that K31R and E37K had decreased affinity, and K26R and T92I
                 variants showed increased affinity for S-protein when compared
                 to wildtype ACE2. Consistent with this, soluble ACE2 K26R and
                 T92I were more effective in blocking entry of S-protein
                 pseudotyped virus suggesting that ACE2 variants can modulate

                 employs host-cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for
                 cell entry. Genetic analyses of ACE2 have identified several
                 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) specific to different
                 human populations. Molecular dynamics simulations have
                 indicated that several of these SNPs could affect interactions
                 between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, thereby providing a partial
                 explanation for the regional differences observed in SARS-CoV-2
                 infectivity and severity. However, the significance of
                 population-specific ACE2 SNPs in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is
                 unknown, as no in vitro validation studies have been performed.
                 Here, we analyzed the impact of eight SNPs found in specific
                 populations on receptor binding and cell entry in vitro. Except
                 for a SNP causing a nonsense mutation that reduced ACE2
                 expression, none of the selected SNPs markedly altered the
                 interaction between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
                 (SARS-2-S), which is responsible for receptor recognition and
                 cell entry, or the efficiency of viral cell entry mediated by
                 SARS-2-S. Our findings indicate that ACE2 polymorphisms have
                 limited impact on the ACE2-dependent cell entry of SARS-CoV-2
                 and underscore the importance of future studies on the
                 involvement of population-specific SNPs of other host genes in
                 susceptibility toward SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

              interacting with other biomolecules; missense variants that cause
              loss of protein function can lead to a broad spectrum of genetic
              disorders. While much progress has been made on predicting which
              missense variants may cause disease, our ability to predict the
              underlying molecular mechanisms remain limited. One common
              mechanism is that missense variants cause protein destabilization
              resulting in lowered protein abundance and loss of function, while
              other variants directly disrupt key interactions with other

              protein sequence and structure to disentangle effects on protein
              function and abundance, and applied our resulting model to all
              missense variants in the human proteome. We find that
              approximately half of all missense variants that lead to loss of
              function and disease do so because they disrupt protein stability.
              We have predicted functionally important positions in all human
              proteins, and find that they cluster on protein structures and are
              often found on the protein surface. Our work provides a resource
              for interpreting both predicted and experimental variant effects
              across the human proteome, and a mechanistic starting point for
              developing therapies towards genetic diseases.",

              increased transmissibility, neutralization resistance and disease
              severity. Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance world-wide has
              improved our ability to rapidly identify such variants. Here we
              report the identification of a potential variant of interest
              assigned to the PANGO lineage C.1.2. This lineage was first
              identified in May 2021 and evolved from C.1, one of the lineages
              that dominated the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in South
              Africa and was last detected in January 2021. C.1.2 has since been
              detected across the majority of the provinces in South Africa and
              in seven other countries spanning Africa, Europe, Asia and
              Oceania. The emergence of C.1.2 was associated with an increased
              substitution rate, as was previously observed with the emergence
              of the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants of concern (VOCs). C.1.2
              contains multiple substitutions (R190S, D215G, E484K, N501Y, H655Y
              and T859N) and deletions (Y144del, L242-A243del) within the spike
              protein, which have been observed in other VOCs and are associated
              with increased transmissibility and reduced neutralization
              sensitivity. Of greater concern is the accumulation of additional
              mutations (C136F, Y449H and N679K) which are also likely to impact
              neutralization sensitivity or furin cleavage and therefore
              replicative fitness. While the phenotypic characteristics and
              epidemiology of C.1.2 are being defined, it is important to
              highlight this lineage given its concerning constellations of
              mutations.",

                 thus altering the biochemical properties at the protein
                 interaction interface. These and other ACE2 coding mutants can
                 reveal how the spike proteins of each virus may differentially
                 engage the ACE2 protein surface during infection. We created an
                 engineered HEK 293T cell line for facile stable transgenic
                 modification, and expressed the major human ACE2 allele or 28
                 of its missense mutants, 24 of which are possible through
                 single nucleotide changes from the human reference sequence.
                 Infection with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped
                 lentiviruses revealed that high ACE2 cell-surface expression
                 could mask the effects of impaired binding during infection.
                 Drastically reducing ACE2 cell surface expression revealed a
                 range of infection efficiencies across the panel of mutants.
                 Our infection results revealed a non-linear relationship
                 between soluble SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 and pseudovirus
                 infection, supporting a major role for binding avidity during
                 entry. While ACE2 mutants D355N, R357A, and R357T abrogated
                 entry by both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, the Y41A
                 mutant inhibited SARS-CoV entry much more than SARS-CoV-2,
                 suggesting differential utilization of the ACE2 side-chains
                 within the largely overlapping interaction surfaces utilized by
                 the two CoV spike proteins. These effects correlated well with
                 cytopathic effects observed during SARS-CoV-2 replication in
                 ACE2-mutant cells. The panel of ACE2 mutants also revealed
                 altered ACE2 surface dependencies by the N501Y spike variant,
                 including a near-complete utilization of the K353D ACE2
                 variant, despite decreased infection mediated by the parental
                 SARS-CoV-2 spike. Our results clarify the relationship between
                 ACE2 abundance, binding, and infection, for various SARS-like
                 coronavirus spike proteins and their mutants, and inform our

                 with different susceptibilities to infection.",

                 complexes in multicellular organisms. By scanning billions of
                 random peptides, we accurately map binding specificity for
                 approximately half of the over 330 PDZ domains in the human and
                 Caenorhabditis elegans proteomes. The domains recognize
                 features of the last seven ligand positions, and we find 16
                 distinct specificity classes conserved from worm to human,
                 significantly extending the canonical two-class system based on
                 position -2. Thus, most PDZ domains are not promiscuous, but
                 rather are fine-tuned for specific interactions. Specificity
                 profiling of 91 point mutants of a model PDZ domain reveals
                 that the binding site is highly robust, as all mutants were
                 able to recognize C-terminal peptides. However, many mutations
                 altered specificity for ligand positions both close and far
                 from the mutated position, suggesting that binding specificity
                 can evolve rapidly under mutational pressure. Our specificity
                 map enables the prediction and prioritization of natural
                 protein interactions, which can be used to guide PDZ domain
                 cell biology experiments. Using this approach, we predicted and
                 validated several viral ligands for the PDZ domains of the
                 SCRIB polarity protein. These findings indicate that many
                 viruses produce PDZ ligands that disrupt host protein complexes
                 for their own benefit, and that highly pathogenic strains
                 target PDZ domains involved in cell polarity and growth.",

                 enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the strength of this interaction could
                 influence parameters relating to virulence. To explore whether
                 population variants in ACE2 influence Spike binding and hence
                 infection, we selected 10 ACE2 variants based on affinity
                 predictions and prevalence in gnomAD and measured their
                 affinities and kinetics for Spike receptor binding domain
                 through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 37°C. We discovered
                 variants that reduce and enhance binding, including three ACE2
                 variants that strongly inhibited (p.Glu37Lys, ΔΔG = -1.33 ±
                 0.15 kcal mol-1 and p.Gly352Val, predicted ΔΔG = -1.17 kcal
                 mol-1) or abolished (p.Asp355Asn) binding. We also identified
                 two variants with distinct population distributions that
                 enhanced affinity for Spike. ACE2 p.Ser19Pro (ΔΔG = 0.59 ± 0.08
                 kcal mol-1) is predominant in the gnomAD African cohort (AF =
                 0.003) whilst p.Lys26Arg (ΔΔG = 0.26 ± 0.09 kcal mol-1) is
                 predominant in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AF = 0.01) and European
                 non-Finnish (AF = 0.006) cohorts. We compared ACE2 variant
                 affinities to published SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype infectivity data
                 and confirmed that ACE2 variants with reduced affinity for
                 Spike can protect cells from infection. The effect of variants
                 with enhanced Spike affinity remains unclear, but we propose a
                 mechanism whereby these alleles could cause greater viral
                 spreading across tissues and cell types, as is consistent with
                 emerging understanding regarding the interplay between receptor
                 affinity and cell-surface abundance. Finally, we compared
                 mCSM-PPI2 ΔΔG predictions against our SPR data to assess the
                 utility of predictions in this system. We found that
                 predictions of decreased binding were well-correlated with
                 experiment and could be improved by calibration, but
                 disappointingly, predictions of highly enhanced binding were
                 unreliable. Recalibrated predictions for all possible ACE2
                 missense variants at the Spike interface were calculated and
                 used to estimate the overall burden of ACE2 variants on

                 are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that have emerged
                 independently worldwide. For example, the B.1.1.7 lineage has a
                 mutation (N501Y) in its Spike RBD that enhances binding to
                 ACE2. There are also ACE2 alleles in humans with mutations in
                 the RBD binding site. Here we perform a detailed affinity and
                 kinetics analysis of the effect of five common RBD mutations
                 (K417N, K417T, N501Y, E484K, and S477N) and two common ACE2

                 increased the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction. The
                 exceptions were mutations K417N/T, which decreased the

              mediates the broad-spectrum severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and
              COVID-19 outcomes. We investigated the capacity of ACE2 variation

              effect of missense variants on the ACE2 SARS-CoV-2 S-protein

              algorithm with 26 published ACE2 mutant SARS-CoV S-protein binding
              assays and found it performed well in this closely related system
              (True Positive Rate = 0.7, True Negative Rate = 1). Application of
              mCSM-PPI2 to ACE2 missense variants from the Genome Aggregation

              strongly inhibit binding and one more that is likely to enhance
              binding (Thr27Arg). A conservative estimate places the prevalence
              of the strongly protective variants between 12-70 per 100,000
              population but there is the possibility of higher prevalence in

                 α-solenoid proteins, in which repetitive units of α-helical
                 hairpin motifs stack to form superhelical, often highly
                 flexible structures. TPR domains occur in a wide variety of
                 proteins, and perform key functional roles including protein
                 folding, protein trafficking, cell cycle control and
                 post-translational modification. Here, we look at the TPR
                 domain of the enzyme O-linked GlcNAc-transferase (OGT), which
                 catalyses O-GlcNAcylation of a broad range of substrate
                 proteins. A number of single-point mutations in the TPR domain
                 of human OGT have been associated with the disease Intellectual
                 Disability (ID). By extended steered and equilibrium atomistic
                 simulations, we show that the OGT-TPR domain acts as an elastic
                 nanospring, and that each of the ID-related local mutations
                 substantially affect the global dynamics of the TPR domain.
                 Since the nanospring character of the OGT-TPR domain is key to
                 its function in binding and releasing OGT substrates, these
                 changes of its biomechanics likely lead to defective substrate
                 interaction. We find that neutral mutations in the human
                 population, selected by analysis of the gnomAD database, do not
                 incur these changes. Our findings may not only help to explain
                 the ID phenotype of the mutants, but also aid the design of TPR
                 proteins with tailored biomechanical properties.",

                 and SOX9. Deletion of the gene encoding Sox8 in mice causes
                 reproductive dysfunction but the role of SOX8 in humans is
                 unknown. Here, we show that SOX8 is expressed in the somatic
                 cells of the early developing gonad in the human and influences
                 human sex determination. We identified two individuals with 46,
                 XY disorders/differences in sex development (DSD) and
                 chromosomal rearrangements encompassing the SOX8 locus and a
                 third individual with 46, XY DSD and a missense mutation in the
                 HMG-box of SOX8. In vitro functional assays indicate that this
                 mutation alters the biological activity of the protein. As an
                 emerging body of evidence suggests that DSDs and infertility
                 can have common etiologies, we also analysed SOX8 in a cohort
                 of infertile men (n = 274) and two independent cohorts of women
                 with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI; n = 153 and n = 104).
                 SOX8 mutations were found at increased frequency in
                 oligozoospermic men (3.5\%; P < 0.05) and POI (5.06\%; P = 4.5
                 × 10-5) as compared with fertile/normospermic control
                 populations (0.74\%). The mutant proteins identified altered
                 SOX8 biological activity as compared with the wild-type
                 protein. These data demonstrate that SOX8 plays an important
                 role in human reproduction and SOX8 mutations contribute to a
                 spectrum of phenotypes including 46, XY DSD, male infertility

  abstract = "Human genome sequencing has generated population variant datasets
              containing millions of variants from hundreds of thousands of
              individuals[1][1]-[3][2]. The datasets show the genomic
              distribution of genetic variation to be influenced on genic and
              sub-genic scales by gene essentiality,[1][1],[4][3],[5][4] protein
              domain architecture[6][5] and the presence of genomic features
              such as splice donor/acceptor sites.[2][6] However, the variant
              data are still too sparse to provide a comparative picture of
              genetic variation between individual protein residues in the
              proteome.[1][1],[6][5] Here, we overcome this sparsity for ∼25,000
              human protein domains in 1,291 domain families by aggregating
              variants over equivalent positions (columns) in multiple sequence
              alignments of sequence-similar (paralagous) domains[7][7],[8][8].
              We then compare the resulting variation profiles from the human
              population to residue conservation across all species[9][9] and
              find that the same tertiary structural and functional pressures
              that affect amino acid conservation during domain evolution
              constrain missense variant distributions. Thus, depletion of
              missense variants at a position implies that it is structurally or
              functionally important. We find such positions are enriched in
              known disease-associated variants (OR = 2.83, p ≈ 0) while
              positions that are both missense depleted and evolutionary
              conserved are further enriched in disease-associated variants (OR
              = 1.85, p = 3.3×10-17) compared to those that are only
              evolutionary conserved (OR = 1.29, p = 4.5×10-19). Unexpectedly, a
              subset of evolutionary Unconserved positions are Missense Depleted
              in human (UMD positions) and these are also enriched in pathogenic
              variants (OR = 1.74, p = 0.02). UMD positions are further
              differentiated from other unconserved residues in that they are
              enriched in ligand, DNA and protein binding interactions (OR =
              1.59, p = 0.003), which suggests this stratification can identify
              functionally important positions. A different class of positions
              that are Conserved and Missense Enriched (CME) show an enrichment
              of ClinVar risk factor variants (OR = 2.27, p = 0.004). We
              illustrate these principles with the G-Protein Coupled Receptor
              (GPCR) family, Nuclear Receptor Ligand Binding Domain family and
              In Between Ring-Finger (IBR) domains and list a total of 343 UMD

              specific proteins by mutagenesis; (b) refining pathogenicity

                 indicate that the bacteriochlorophylls (BChls) display a
                 significant degree of conformational heterogeneity of their
                 peripheral substituents and the protein-induced nonplanar
                 skeletal deformations of the tetrapyrrole macrocycle. As
                 electronic properties of chromophores are altered by such
                 differences, a conformational effect may influence the
                 site-energies of specific pigments and thus play a role in
                 mediating the excitation energy transfer dynamics, but this has
                 not yet been established. The difficulty of assessing this
                 question is shown to be partly the result of the inability of
                 the sequential truncation approach usually employed to account
                 for interactions between the conformations of the macrocycle
                 and its substituents and an alternative approach is suggested.
                 By assigning the BChl atoms to meaningful atom groups and
                 performing all possible permutations of partial optimizations
                 in a full-factorial design, where each group is either frozen
                 in the crystal geometry or optimized in vacuo, followed by
                 excited state calculations on each resulting structure
                 (PM6//ZIndo/S), the specific effects of the conformations of
                 each BChl component as well as mutual interactions between the
                 molecular fragments on the site-energy can be delineated. This
                 factorial relaxation procedure gives different estimates of the
                 macrocycle conformational perturbation than the approach of
                 sequentially truncating the BChl periphery. The results were
                 evaluated in the context of published site-energies for the FMO
                 pigments from three species to identify how conformational
                 effects contribute to their distribution and instances of
                 cross-species conservation and functional divergence of the
                 BChl nonplanarity conformational contribution are described.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Hereditary Fibrosing Poikiloderma (HFP) with tendon
                 contractures, myopathy and pulmonary fibrosis (POIKTMP [MIM
                 615704]) is a very recently described entity of syndromic
                 inherited poikiloderma. Previously by using whole exome
                 sequencing in five families, we identified the causative gene,
                 FAM111B (NM\_198947.3), the function of which is still unknown.
                 Our objective in this study was to better define the specific
                 features of POIKTMP through a larger series of patients.
                 METHODS: Clinical and molecular data of two families and eight
                 independent sporadic cases, including six new cases, were
                 collected. RESULTS: Key features consist of: (i) early-onset
                 poikiloderma, hypotrichosis and hypohidrosis; (ii) multiple
                 contractures, in particular triceps surae muscle contractures;
                 (iii) diffuse progressive muscular weakness; (iv) pulmonary
                 fibrosis in adulthood and (v) other features including exocrine
                 pancreatic insufficiency, liver impairment and growth
                 retardation. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging was informative
                 and showed muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration. Histological
                 examination of skeletal muscle revealed extensive fibroadipose
                 tissue infiltration. Microscopy of the skin showed a
                 scleroderma-like aspect with fibrosis and alterations of the
                 elastic network. FAM111B gene analysis identified five
                 different missense variants (two recurrent mutations were found
                 respectively in three and four independent families). All the
                 mutations were predicted to localize in the trypsin-like
                 cysteine/serine peptidase domain of the protein. We suggest
                 gain-of-function or dominant-negative mutations resulting in
                 FAM111B enzymatic activity changes. CONCLUSIONS: HFP with
                 tendon contractures, myopathy and pulmonary fibrosis, is a
                 multisystemic disorder due to autosomal dominant FAM111B
                 mutations. Future functional studies will help in understanding
                 the specific pathological process of this fibrosing disorder.",

  abstract    = "Tetrapyrrole-containing proteins are one of the most
                 fundamental classes of enzymes in nature and it remains an open
                 question to give a chemical rationale for the multitude of
                 biological reactions that can be catalyzed by these
                 pigment-protein complexes. There are many fundamental processes
                 where the same (i.e., chemically identical) porphyrin cofactor
                 is involved in chemically quite distinct reactions. For
                 example, heme is the active cofactor for oxygen transport and
                 storage (hemoglobin, myoglobin) and for the incorporation of
                 molecular oxygen in organic substrates (cytochrome P450). It is
                 involved in the terminal oxidation (cytochrome c oxidase) and
                 the metabolism of H2O2 (catalases and peroxidases) and
                 catalyzes various electron transfer reactions in cytochromes.
                 Likewise, in photosynthesis the same chlorophyll cofactor may
                 function as a reaction center pigment (charge separation) or as
                 an accessory pigment (exciton transfer) in light harvesting
                 complexes (e.g., chlorophyll a). Whilst differences in the
                 apoprotein sequences alone cannot explain the often drastic
                 differences in physicochemical properties encountered for the
                 same cofactor in diverse protein complexes, a critical factor
                 for all biological functions must be the close structural
                 interplay between bound cofactors and the respective apoprotein
                 in addition to factors such as hydrogen bonding or electronic
                 effects. Here, we explore how nature can use the same chemical
                 molecule as a cofactor for chemically distinct reactions using
                 the concept of conformational flexibility of tetrapyrroles. The
                 multifaceted roles of tetrapyrroles are discussed in the
                 context of the current knowledge on distorted porphyrins.
                 Contemporary analytical methods now allow a more quantitative
                 look at cofactors in protein complexes and the development of
                 the field is illustrated by case studies on hemeproteins and
                 photosynthetic complexes. Specific tetrapyrrole conformations
                 are now used to prepare bioengineered designer proteins with
                 specific catalytic or photochemical properties.",

                 metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome is a recently recognized
                 syndrome caused by mutations in the desmoglein 1 gene (DSG1).
                 To date, only 3 families have been reported. OBJECTIVE: We
                 studied a new case of SAM syndrome known to have no mutations
                 in DSG1 to detail the clinical, histopathologic,
                 immunofluorescent, and ultrastructural phenotype and to
                 identify the underlying molecular mechanisms in this rare
                 genodermatosis. METHODS: Histopathologic, electron microscopy,
                 and immunofluorescent studies were performed. Whole-exome
                 sequencing data were interrogated for mutations in desmosomal
                 and other skin structural genes, followed by Sanger sequencing
                 of candidate genes in the patient and his parents. RESULTS: No
                 mutations were identified in DSG1; however, a novel de novo
                 heterozygous missense c.1757A>C mutation in the desmoplakin
                 gene (DSP) was identified in the patient, predicting the amino
                 acid substitution p.His586Pro in the desmoplakin polypeptide.
                 CONCLUSIONS: SAM syndrome can be caused by mutations in both
                 DSG1 and DSP. Knowledge of this genetic heterogeneity is
                 important for both analysis of patients and genetic counseling
                 of families. This condition and these observations reinforce
                 the importance of heritable skin barrier defects, in this case
                 desmosomal proteins, in the pathogenesis of atopic disease.",

                 be exploited by algorithms like AlphaFold to predict structure
                 and other features. Human population sequencing offers the
                 potential to show similar trends within a single species.
                 However, although gene-level and domain-level aggregation of
                 variants is routinely applied, data still preclude simple
                 residue-level analysis per protein. Here, we aggregate
                 population variants within protein domain families to define
                 the missense enrichment score (MES) which captures population
                 constraint at positions in the family. Contrasting MES with
                 evolutionary conservation identifies positions that are key to
                 protein-ligand and protein-protein interaction specificity as
                 well as locations critical to folding, function and
                 pathogenicity. This approach also highlights a new class of
                 pathogenic variant hot spot at positions that are

                 13,490 positions in 3,591 families were enriched in missense
                 variants (340,829 residues in human) and provide a map of
                 residue-level population constraint in human. Comparison to

                 covering 40,394 sequences from 3,661 Pfam domains, and over
                 10,000 variants labelled pathogenic in ClinVar provides
                 validation of these sites in context with structure and
                 pathogenicity. Application to the GPCR family identifies 17
                 sites important for ligand binding specificity as well as sites

                 sites from protein sequence and/or structure is a long-standing
                 problem in computational biology. Most current approaches make
                 use of sequence conservation, assuming that amino acid residues
                 conserved within a protein family are most likely to be
                 functionally important. Most often these approaches do not
                 consider many residues that act to define specific
                 sub-functions within a family, or they make no distinction
                 between residues important for function and those more relevant
                 for maintaining structure (e.g. in the hydrophobic core). Many
                 protein families bind and/or act on a variety of ligands,
                 meaning that conserved residues often only bind a common ligand
                 sub-structure or perform general catalytic activities. RESULTS:
                 Here we present a novel method for functional site prediction
                 based on identification of conserved positions, as well as
                 those responsible for determining ligand specificity. We define
                 Specificity-Determining Positions (SDPs), as those occupied by
                 conserved residues within sub-groups of proteins in a family
                 having a common specificity, but differ between groups, and are
                 thus likely to account for specific recognition events. We
                 benchmark the approach on enzyme families of known 3D structure
                 with bound substrates, and find that in nearly all families
                 residues predicted by SDPsite are in contact with the bound
                 substrate, and that the addition of SDPs significantly improves
                 functional site prediction accuracy. We apply SDPsite to
                 various families of proteins containing known three-dimensional
                 structures, but lacking clear functional annotations, and
                 discusse several illustrative examples. CONCLUSION: The results

              that the constraint on missense variation at individual amino acid
              sites is largely shaped by direct 3D interactions with neighboring
              sites. To quantify the constraint on protein-coding genetic
              variation in 3D spatial neighborhoods, we introduce a new
              framework called COntact Set MISsense tolerance (or COSMIS) for
              estimating constraint. Leveraging recent advances in computational
              structure prediction, large-scale sequencing data from gnomAD, and
              a mutation-spectrum-aware statistical model, we comprehensively
              map the landscape of 3D spatial constraint on 6.1 amino acid sites
              covering >80\% (16,533) of human proteins. We show that the human
              proteome is broadly under 3D spatial constraint and that the level
              of spatial constraint is strongly associated with disease
              relevance both at the individual site level and the protein level.
              We demonstrate that COSMIS performs significantly better at a
              range of variant interpretation tasks than other population-based
              constraint metrics while also providing biophysical insight into
              the potential functional roles of constrained sites. We make our

                 components of transcriptional regulatory networks in bacteria.
                 LacI-family TFs (LacI-TFs) are broadly distributed among
                 certain lineages of bacteria. The majority of characterized
                 LacI-TFs sense sugar effectors and regulate carbohydrate
                 utilization genes. The comparative genomics approaches enable
                 in silico identification of TF-binding sites and regulon
                 reconstruction. To study the function and evolution of
                 LacI-TFs, we performed genomics-based reconstruction and
                 comparative analysis of their regulons. For over 1300 LacI-TFs
                 from over 270 bacterial genomes, we predicted their cognate
                 DNA-binding motifs and identified target genes. Using the
                 genome context and metabolic subsystem analyses of
                 reconstructed regulons, we tentatively assigned functional
                 roles and predicted candidate effectors for 78 and 67\% of the
                 analyzed LacI-TFs, respectively. Nearly 90\% of the studied
                 LacI-TFs are local regulators of sugar utilization pathways,
                 whereas the remaining 125 global regulators control large and
                 diverse sets of metabolic genes. The global LacI-TFs include
                 the previously known regulators CcpA in Firmicutes, FruR in
                 Enterobacteria, and PurR in Gammaproteobacteria, as well as the
                 three novel regulators-GluR, GapR, and PckR-that are predicted
                 to control the central carbohydrate metabolism in three
                 lineages of Alphaproteobacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of
                 regulators combined with the reconstructed regulons provides a
                 model of evolutionary diversification of the LacI protein
                 family. The obtained genomic collection of in silico

                 binding domain (RBD) have been identified to influence its
                 affinity for the human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2).
                 Here, we perform a comparative study of the ACE2 binding to the
                 wild type (Wuhan) RBD and some of its variants: Alpha B.1.1.7,
                 Beta B.1.351, Delta B.1.617.2, Kappa B.1.617.1, B.1.1.7+L452R
                 and Omicron B.1.1.529. Using a coiled-coil mediated tethering
                 approach of ACE2 in a novel surface plasmon resonance
                 (SPR)-based assay, we measured interactions at different
                 temperatures. Binding experiments at 10°C enhanced the kinetic
                 dissimilarities between the RBD variants and allowed a proper
                 fit to a Langmuir 1:1 model with high accuracy and
                 reproducibility. The Omicron RBD variant has the highest
                 affinity for ACE2, followed by the Alpha (N501Y) and Beta
                 (K417N, E484K, N501Y) variants. However, variants with the
                 L452R mutation, i.e. the B.1.1.7+L452R (L452R, N501Y; which we

                 showed faster kinetics resulting in significatively lower

                 the importance of SPR-based assay parameters in the acquisition
                 of quality data and offers a powerful tool to deepen our

                 has first emerged from China in December 2019 and causes
                 coronavirus induced disease 19 (COVID-19). Since then
                 researchers worldwide have been struggling to detect the
                 possible pathogenesis of this disease. COVID-19 showed a wide
                 range of clinical behavior from asymptomatic to severe acute
                 respiratory disease syndrome. However, the etiology of
                 susceptibility to severe lung injury is not yet fully
                 understood. Angiotensin-converting enzyme1 (ACE1) convert
                 angiotensin I into Angiotensin II that was further metabolized
                 by ACE 2 (ACE2). The binding ACE2 receptor to SARS-CoV-2
                 facilitate its enter into the host cell. The interaction and
                 imbalance between ACE1 and ACE2 play a crucial role in the
                 pathogenesis of lung injury. Thus, the aim of this study was to
                 investigate the association of ACE1 I/D polymorphism with
                 severity of Covid-19. The study included RT-PCR confirmed 269
                 cases of Covid-19. All cases were genotyped for ACE1 I/D
                 polymorphism using polymerase chain reaction and followed by
                 statistical analysis (SPSS, version 15.0). We found that ACE1
                 DD genotype, frequency of D allele, older age (≥46 years),
                 unmarried status, and presence of diabetes and hypertension
                 were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 patient. ACE1 ID
                 genotype was significantly independently associated with high
                 socio-economic COVID-19 patients (OR: 2.48, 95\% CI:
                 1.331-4.609). These data suggest that the ACE1 genotype may
                 impact the incidence and clinical outcome of COVID-19 and serve
                 as a predictive marker for COVID-19 risk and severity.",

                 COVID-19. First, ACE2 is the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2,
                 and expression of the ACE2 gene could regulate the individuaĺs
                 susceptibility to infection. In addition, the balance between
                 ACE1 and ACE2 activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis
                 of respiratory diseases and could play a role in the severity
                 of COVID-19. Functional ACE1/ACE2 gene polymorphisms have been
                 associated with the risk of cardiovascular and pulmonary
                 diseases, and could thus also contribute to the outcome of
                 COVID-19. We studied 204 COVID-19 patients (137 non-severe and
                 67 severe-ICU cases) and 536 age-matched controls. The ACE1
                 insertion/deletion and ACE2 rs2285666 polymorphism were
                 determined. Variables frequencies were compared between the
                 groups by logistic regression. We also sequenced the ACE2
                 coding nucleotides in a group of patients. Severe COVID-19 was
                 associated with hypertension male gender (p < 0.001),
                 hypertension (p = 0.006), hypercholesterolaemia (p = 0.046),
                 and the ACE1-DD genotype (p = 0.049). In the multiple logistic
                 regression hypertension (p = 0.02, OR = 2.26, 95\%CI =
                 1.12-4.63) and male gender (p = 0.002; OR = 3.15, 95\%CI =
                 1.56-6.66) remained as independent significant predictors of
                 severity. The ACE2 polymorphism was not associated with the
                 disease outcome. The ACE2 sequencing showed no coding sequence

                 associated with male gender, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia
                 and the ACE1 genotype. Our work suggested that the ACE1-I/D
                 might influence COVID-19 severity, but the effect was dependent
                 on the hypertensive status. This result requires further
                 validation in other large cohorts.",

                 (SARS-CoV-2) is believed to have emerged from Wuhan, China, and
                 spreads over 215 countries worldwide. The spike protein of
                 SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2)
                 receptors and enter the host cells. Several reports have been
                 highlighted the importance of ACE-2 on the pathogenesis of
                 COVID-19. In the present study, we hypothesize that a
                 functional insertion/deletion polymorphism in the ACE gene
                 could be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality.
                 MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed and Google scholar search engines
                 were used to obtained data on the prevalence of ACE I/D
                 polymorphism in different countries of the Asia continent. Data
                 on COVID-19 infection rate (per million), mortality/million,
                 and percentage of recovery were acquired form worldometer
                 website. The Spearman rank correlation test performed to
                 investigate the correlation of allele 'D' with SARS-CoV-2
                 infection, mortality rate, and recovery percentage. RESULTS:
                 Epidemiological investigation revealed a significant positive
                 correlation of D allele of ACE polymorphism with SARS-CoV-2
                 infection (r = 0.502, p = 0.008, n = 26) and mortality rate (r
                 = 0.620, p = 0.002, n = 22) in Asian population. However, no
                 significant role of ACE I/D polymorphism was observed with
                 recovery rate of patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection (r =
                 -0.208, p = 0.352, n = 22). CONCLUSIONS: Allele D of ACE
                 insertion/deletion polymorphism is associated with the rate of

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) genotypes are
                 known to be associated with development of acute respiratory
                 distress syndrome (ARDS) and resultant mortality. In the
                 present study, we examined the association between distribution
                 frequency of ACE genotypes and COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: We
                 undertook an ecological study to examine the association
                 between ACE genotypes and COVID-19 mortality across 25
                 countries to represent different geographical regions of the
                 world. The population frequencies of ACE genotypes were drawn
                 from previously published reports and data on COVID-19-related
                 mortality were extracted from 'Worldometer'. Multivariable
                 analyses were also undertaken adjusting for age (median age),
                 sex (percentage of females) and the number of COVID-19 tests
                 undertaken. Associations between genotypes deletion/deletion
                 (DD) and insertion/insertion (II) prevalence and
                 COVID-19-related mortality (per million people per day since
                 the first diagnosed case) were evaluated. RESULTS: The
                 frequency of II genotype is highest in east Asian countries and
                 lower among the European and African countries. An inverse
                 geographical distribution frequency was noted for DD genotype.
                 Increasing II genotype frequency was significantly associated
                 with decreased COVID-19 mortality rates (adjusted incident rate
                 ratio [IRR] 0.3, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.002-0.7, p =
                 0.03). However, no association was found between DD genotype
                 frequency and COVID-19 mortality rates (adjusted IRR 4.3, 95\%
                 CI: 0.5-41.2, p = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Distribution frequency of
                 ACE insertion/insertion (II) genotype may have a significant
                 influence on COVID-19 mortality. This information has potential
                 utility for resource planning at a systemic level, as well as

                 angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene and the risk for acute
                 lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
                 remains controversial despite the publication of four
                 meta-analyses on this topic. Here, we updated the meta-analysis
                 with more studies and additional assessments that include
                 adults and children within the context of the coronavirus
                 disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Sixteen articles (22
                 studies) were included. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence
                 intervals (CIs) were estimated using three genetic models
                 (allele, recessive and dominant), in which ARDS patients were
                 compared with non-ARDS patients (A1) and healthy controls (A2).
                 Mortality outcomes were also assessed (A3). The influence of
                 covariates was examined by meta-regression. Bonferroni
                 correction was performed for multiple pooled associations.
                 Subgroup analyses based on ethnicity (Asians, Caucasians) and
                 life stage (adults, children) were conducted. Heterogeneity was
                 addressed with outlier treatment. RESULTS: This meta-analysis
                 generated 68 comparisons, 21 of which were significant. Of the
                 21, four A1 and three A3 highly significant (Pa =
                 0.00001-0.0008) outcomes withstood Bonferroni correction. For
                 A1, allele and recessive associations were found in overall (OR
                 0.49, 95\% CI 0.39-0.61), Caucasians (OR 0.46, 95\% CI
                 0.35-0.61) and children (ORs 0.49-0.66, 95\% CI 0.33-0.84)
                 analyses. For A3, associations were found in overall (dominant:
                 OR 0.45, 95\% CI 0.29-0.68) and Asian subgroup (allele/
                 dominant: ORs 0.31-0.39, 95\% CIs 0.18-0.63) analyses. These
                 outcomes were either robust, or statistically powered or both
                 and uninfluenced by covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Significant
                 associations of the ACE I/D polymorphism with the risk of
                 ALI/ARDS were indicated in Caucasians and children as well as
                 in Asians in mortality analysis. These findings were
                 underpinned by high significance, high statistical power and
                 robustness. ACE genotypes may be useful for ALI/ARDS therapy

                 discrepancy in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and antiviral
                 drugs among different populations might be due to their
                 different ACE2 SNPs and/or miRNAs profile. ACE2 is the major
                 component for SARS-CoV-2s' cell entry, and disruption of its 3D
                 structure could influence virus-ACE2 interaction. In this study
                 we aimed to investigate the consequence of 16,860 SNPs within
                 ACE2 on its expression as well as protein folding, function,
                 and stability by using several beneficial bioinformatics tools.
                 Only 64 SNPs including 60 intronic, and 4 missense showed
                 different frequencies among different populations. Two missense
                 SNPs including rs149039346 and rs147311723 have been predicted
                 to strongly influence the function and stability of ACE2.
                 rs1514283 creates new acceptor splice site. Also, rs4646175
                 creates new donor and acceptor splice site. PolymiRTS, and
                 miRSNPs have predicted that rs3746444, rs113808830, and
                 rs3751304 showed a MAF > 0.001, and disrupted mRNA target sites
                 or mRNA function. Finally, rs3746444 hsa-miR-499a-3p,
                 rs113808830 hsa-miR-4532, rs3751304 hsa-miR-6763-3p and
                 hsa-miR-26b-5p were strongly hybridized with ACE2 and might
                 influence its function. Collectively, this study shed some
                 light on fundamental roles of ACE2 SNPs for its interaction
                 with COVID-19, and consequently susceptibility to virus.
                 Therefore, different responses of patients with COVID-19 to
                 ACE2 blocker drugs might be due to their unique ACE2 SNPs. We
                 further discussed the impact of SNPs on miRNAs profile as a

                 caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome caused
                 by Coronavirus 2) began in December 2019. Its closest relative,
                 SARS-CoV-1, has a slightly mutated Spike (S) protein, which
                 interacts with ACE2 receptor in human cells to start the
                 infection. So far, there are no vaccines or drugs to treat
                 COVID-19. So, research groups worldwide are seeking new
                 molecules targeting the S protein to prevent infection by
                 SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 establishment. We performed molecular
                 docking analysis of eight synthetic peptides against SARS-CoV-2
                 S protein. All interacted with the protein, but Mo-CBP3-PepII
                 and PepKAA had the highest affinity with it. By binding to the
                 S protein, both peptides led to conformational alterations in
                 the protein, resulting in incorrect interaction with ACE2.
                 Therefore, given the importance of the S protein-ACE2
                 interaction for SARS-CoV-2 infection, synthetic peptides could
                 block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, unlike other antiviral
                 drugs, peptides have no toxicity to human cells. Thus, these

                 been growing since its first identification in December 2019.
                 The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable
                 source of data to study the details about its phylogeny,
                 evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein
                 binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting
                 enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor through
                 which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we
                 provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike
                 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus
                 isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating the binding
                 energy score between RBD and ACE2, we highlighted the putative
                 jump in the affinity from a progenitor form of SARS-CoV-2 to
                 the current virus responsible for COVID-19 outbreak. Our result
                 was consistent with previously reported phylogenetic analysis
                 and corroborates the opinion that the interface segment of the
                 spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex
                 evolutionary process rather than a progressive accumulation of
                 mutations. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499
                 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to human ACE2
                 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Moreover, we
                 show from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the
                 interface residues to be the result of genetic engineering.
                 Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants
                 located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex
                 formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is
                 likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of
                 SARS-CoV-2.",

                 zoonotic viruses, triggering numerous outbreaks and a severe
                 global health crisis. The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by
                 SARS-CoV-2 has affected more than 51 million people across the
                 globe as of 12 November 2020. The crown-like spikes on the
                 surface of the virion are the unique structural feature of
                 viruses in the family Coronaviridae. The spike (S) protein
                 adopts distinct conformations while mediating entry of the
                 virus into the host. This multifunctional protein mediates the
                 entry process by recognizing its receptor on the host cell,
                 followed by the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell
                 membrane. This review article focuses on the structural and
                 functional comparison of S proteins of the human
                 betacoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome
                 coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome

                 varied lengths, structures, and mechanisms that ubiquitously
                 influence gene expression and translation, genome stability and
                 dynamics, and human health and disease. Here, to shed light on
                 their functional determinants, we seek to exploit the
                 evolutionary record of variation and divergence read from
                 sequence comparisons. The approach follows the phylogenetic
                 Evolutionary Trace (ET) paradigm, first developed and
                 extensively validated on proteins. We assigned a relative rank
                 of importance to every base in a study of 1070 functional RNAs,
                 including the ribosome, and observed evolutionary patterns
                 strikingly similar to those seen in proteins, namely, (1) the
                 top-ranked bases clustered in secondary and tertiary
                 structures. (2) In turn, these clusters mapped functional
                 regions for catalysis, binding proteins and drugs,
                 post-transcriptional modification, and deleterious mutations.
                 (3) Moreover, the quantitative quality of these clusters
                 correlated with the identification of functional regions. (4)
                 As a result of this correlation, smoother structural
                 distributions of evolutionary important nucleotides improved
                 functional site predictions. Thus, in practice, phylogenetic
                 analysis can broadly identify functional determinants in RNA
                 sequences and functional sites in RNA structures, and reveal
                 details on the basis of RNA molecular functions. As example of
                 application, we report several previously undocumented and
                 potentially functional ET nucleotide clusters in the ribosome.
                 This work is broadly relevant to studies of structure-function
                 in ribonucleic acids. Additionally, this generalization of ET
                 shows that evolutionary constraints among sequence, structure,
                 and function are similar in structured RNA and proteins. RNA ET
                 is currently available as part of the ET command-line package,

                 various levels of biological organization remains a practical
                 and conceptual challenge. Here, we introduce a network approach
                 for evaluating the impact of rare gene defects across
                 biological scales. We construct a multiplex network consisting
                 of over 20 million gene relationships that are organized into
                 46 network layers spanning six major biological scales between
                 genotype and phenotype. A comprehensive analysis of 3,771 rare
                 diseases reveals distinct phenotypic modules within individual

                 on the cell surface, where they present peptides to T cells,
                 which gives them a key role in the development of T-cell immune
                 responses. MHC molecules come in two main variants: MHC Class I
                 (MHC-I) and MHC Class II (MHC-II). MHC-I predominantly present
                 peptides derived from intracellular proteins, whereas MHC-II
                 predominantly presents peptides from extracellular proteins. In
                 both cases, the binding between MHC and antigenic peptides is
                 the most selective step in the antigen presentation pathway.
                 Therefore, the prediction of peptide binding to MHC is a
                 powerful utility to predict the possible specificity of a
                 T-cell immune response. Commonly MHC binding prediction tools
                 are trained on binding affinity or mass spectrometry-eluted
                 ligands. Recent studies have however demonstrated how the
                 integration of both data types can boost predictive

                 variants, we ran a protein family-specific benchmarking of
                 tools for predicting the pathogenicity of single amino acid
                 variants. We find that despite the high overall accuracy of all
                 tested methods, each tool has its Achilles heel, i.e. protein
                 families in which its predictions prove unreliable (expected
                 accuracy does not exceed 51\% in any method). As a proof of
                 principle, we show that choosing the optimal tool and
                 pathogenicity threshold at a protein family-individual level
                 allows obtaining reliable predictions in all Pfam domains
                 (accuracy no less than 68\%). A functional analysis of the sets
                 of protein domains annotated exclusively by neutral or
                 pathogenic mutations indicates that specific protein functions
                 can be associated with a high or low sensitivity to mutations,
                 respectively. The highly sensitive sets of protein domains are
                 involved in the regulation of transcription and DNA
                 sequence-specific transcription factor binding, while the
                 domains that do not result in disease when mutated are
                 responsible for mediating immune and stress responses. These

                 performance. Here, we describe MVP (Missense Variant

                 deep residual network to leverage large training data sets and
                 many correlated predictors. We train the model separately in
                 genes that are intolerant of loss of function variants and the
                 ones that are tolerant in order to take account of potentially
                 different genetic effect size and mode of action. We compile
                 cancer mutation hotspots and de novo variants from

                 in genomes, modulating both how frequently they arise and how
                 efficiently natural selection is able to filter them, is well
                 established. It is therefore clear that these distinct roles
                 for population size that characterize different processes
                 should affect the evolution of proteins and need to be
                 carefully defined. Empirical evidence is consistent with a role
                 for demography in influencing protein evolution, supporting the
                 idea that functional constraints alone do not determine the
                 composition of coding sequences.Given that the relationship
                 between population size, mutant fitness and fixation
                 probability has been well characterized, estimating fitness
                 from observed substitutions is well within reach with
                 well-formulated models. Molecular evolution research has,
                 therefore, increasingly begun to leverage concepts from
                 population genetics to quantify the selective effects
                 associated with different classes of mutation. However, in
                 order for this type of analysis to provide meaningful
                 information about the intra- and inter-specific evolution of
                 coding sequences, a clear definition of concepts of population
                 size, what they influence, and how they are best parameterized
                 is essential.Here, we present an overview of the many distinct
                 concepts that ``population size'' and ``effective population
                 size'' may refer to, what they represent for studying proteins,
                 and how this knowledge can be harnessed to produce better
                 specified models of protein evolution.",

               acids and secondarily their spatial arrangements in

  abstract    = "The 1000 Genomes Project data provides a natural background
                 dataset for amino acid germline mutations in humans. Since the
                 direction of mutation is known, the amino acid exchange matrix
                 generated from the observed nucleotide variants is asymmetric
                 and the mutabilities of the different amino acids are very
                 different. These differences predominantly reflect preferences
                 for nucleotide mutations in the DNA (especially the high
                 mutation rate of the CpG dinucleotide, which makes arginine
                 mutability very much higher than other amino acids) rather than
                 selection imposed by protein structure constraints, although
                 there is evidence for the latter as well. The variants occur
                 predominantly on the surface of proteins (82\%), with a slight
                 preference for sites which are more exposed and less well
                 conserved than random. Mutations to functional residues occur
                 about half as often as expected by chance. The
                 disease-associated amino acid variant distributions in OMIM are
                 radically different from those expected on the basis of the
                 1000 Genomes dataset. The disease-associated variants
                 preferentially occur in more conserved sites, compared to 1000
                 Genomes mutations. Many of the amino acid exchange profiles
                 appear to exhibit an anti-correlation, with common exchanges in
                 one dataset being rare in the other. Disease-associated
                 variants exhibit more extreme differences in amino acid size
                 and hydrophobicity. More modelling of the mutational processes
                 at the nucleotide level is needed, but these observations
                 should contribute to an improved prediction of the effects of
                 specific variants in humans.",

                 catalogue structural and functional features of proteins that
                 restrain genetic variation leading to single amino acid
                 substitutions. Our variation dataset is divided into three

                 polymorphisms and iii) cancer somatic mutations. We
                 characterize structural environments of the amino acid variants
                 by the following properties: i) side-chain solvent
                 accessibility, ii) main-chain secondary structure, and iii)
                 hydrogen bonds from a side chain to a main chain or other side

  abstract    = "A newly described coronavirus named severe acute respiratory
                 syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative
                 agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected over
                 2.3 million people, led to the death of more than 160,000
                 individuals and caused worldwide social and economic
                 disruption1,2. There are no antiviral drugs with proven
                 clinical efficacy for the treatment of COVID-19, nor are there
                 any vaccines that prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, and
                 efforts to develop drugs and vaccines are hampered by the
                 limited knowledge of the molecular details of how SARS-CoV-2
                 infects cells. Here we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the
                 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified the human
                 proteins that physically associated with each of the SARS-CoV-2
                 proteins using affinity-purification mass spectrometry,
                 identifying 332 high-confidence protein-protein interactions
                 between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins. Among these, we identify
                 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69
                 compounds (of which, 29 drugs are approved by the US Food and
                 Drug Administration, 12 are in clinical trials and 28 are
                 preclinical compounds). We screened a subset of these in
                 multiple viral assays and found two sets of pharmacological
                 agents that displayed antiviral activity: inhibitors of mRNA
                 translation and predicted regulators of the sigma-1 and sigma-2
                 receptors. Further studies of these host-factor-targeting
                 agents, including their combination with drugs that directly
                 target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to
                 treat COVID-19.",

                 gene-I (RIG-I), are involved in antiviral immunity.
                 Caenorhabditis elegans DRH-1 and DRH-3 play crucial roles in
                 antiviral function and chromosome segregation, respectively.
                 Although intrinsic double-stranded RNA-dependent
                 ATP-hydrolyzing activity has been observed in the recombinant
                 DRH-3 protein prepared from Escherichia coli, there are no
                 reports of biochemical studies of the nematode RIG-I homolog
                 DRH-1. In this study, the secondary structure prediction by
                 JPred4 revealed that DRH-1 and DRH-3 had distinct N-terminal
                 regions and that a 200-amino acid N-terminal region of DRH-1
                 could form a structure very rich in α-helices. We investigated
                 expressions and purifications of a codon-optimized DRH-1 with
                 four different N-terminal tags, identifying poly-histidine
                 (His)-small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) as a suitable tag
                 for DRH-1 preparation. Full-length (isoform a) and a N-terminal
                 truncated (isoform b) of DRH-1 were purified as the
                 His-SUMO-tagged fusion proteins. Finally, the nucleic

                 DRH-3 exhibited dsRNA-dependent ATPase activity. However,
                 detectable dsRNA dependency of ATPase activities was not found
                 in either isoform of tagged DRH-1 and a tag-free DRH-1 (isoform
                 a) treated with SUMO protease. These observations suggest that
                 DRH-1 and its short isoform have no or poor nucleic

                 polymerases and regulate transcription processivity and
                 termination. RfaH, a divergent sub-family in its evolutionary
                 history, is known for displaying distinct features than those
                 in NusG proteins, which allows them to regulate the expression
                 of virulence factors in enterobacteria in a DNA
                 sequence-dependent manner. A striking feature is its structural
                 interconversion between an active fold, which is the canonical
                 NusG three-dimensional structure, and an autoinhibited fold,

                 within RfaH sequence to encode a metamorphic protein remains
                 elusive. In this work, we used publicly available genomic RfaH

                 conformation as an effect of few mutations or weak
                 environmental variations. However, modeling those processes is
                 extremely difficult due to the need of efficiently exploring a

                 path. In this study, we report a strategy that simplifies this
                 task attacking the complexity on several sides. We first apply
                 a minimalist coarse-grained model to the protein, based on an
                 empirical force field with a partial structural bias toward one

                 fold-switching residues, a result that contrasts with overall
                 low confidences for intrinsically disordered proteins, which
                 are also structurally heterogeneous. To investigate factors
                 contributing to this disparity, we quantified sequence
                 variation within the multiple sequence alignments used to
                 generate AlphaFold2's predictions of fold-switching and
                 intrinsically disordered proteins. Unlike intrinsically
                 disordered regions, whose sequence alignments show low
                 conservation, fold-switching regions had conservation rates
                 statistically similar to canonical single-fold proteins.
                 Furthermore, intrinsically disordered regions had
                 systematically lower prediction confidences than either
                 fold-switching or single-fold proteins, regardless of sequence
                 conservation. AlphaFold2's high prediction confidences for fold
                 switchers indicate that it uses sophisticated pattern
                 recognition to search for one most probable conformer rather
                 than protein biophysics to model a protein's structural
                 ensemble. Thus, it is not surprising that its predictions often
                 fail for proteins whose properties are not fully apparent from
                 solved protein structures. Our results emphasize the need to
                 look at protein structure as an ensemble and suggest that
                 systematic examination of fold-switching sequences may reveal
                 propensities for multiple stable secondary and tertiary

                 one-structure/one-function paradigm, an increasing number of
                 proteins with dual structures and functions have been
                 discovered. In response to cellular stimuli, such proteins
                 undergo structural changes sufficiently dramatic to remodel
                 even their secondary structures and domain organization. This
                 ``fold-switching'' capability fosters protein
                 multi-functionality, enabling cells to establish tight control
                 over various biochemical processes. Accurate predictions of
                 fold-switching proteins could both suggest underlying
                 mechanisms for uncharacterized biological processes and reveal
                 potential drug targets. Recently, we developed a prediction
                 method for fold-switching proteins using structure-based
                 thermodynamic calculations and discrepancies between predicted
                 and experimentally determined protein secondary structure
                 (Porter and Looger, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2018;
                 115:5968-5973). Here we seek to leverage the negative
                 information found in these secondary structure prediction
                 discrepancies. To do this, we quantified secondary structure
                 prediction accuracies of 192 known fold-switching regions
                 (FSRs) within solved protein structures found in the Protein
                 Data Bank (PDB). We find that the secondary structure
                 prediction accuracies for these FSRs vary widely. Inaccurate
                 secondary structure predictions are strongly associated with
                 fold-switching proteins compared to equally long segments of
                 non-fold-switching proteins selected at random. These
                 inaccurate predictions are enriched in helix-to-strand and
                 strand-to-coil discrepancies. Finally, we find that most
                 proteins with inaccurate secondary structure predictions are
                 underrepresented in the PDB compared with their alternatively
                 folded cognates, suggesting that unequal representation of
                 fold-switching conformers within the PDB could be an important
                 cause of inaccurate secondary structure predictions. These
                 results demonstrate that inconsistent secondary structure
                 predictions can serve as a useful preliminary marker of fold

                 similar sequences assume the same folds and perform similar
                 functions, an increasing number of exceptions is emerging. One
                 class of exceptions comprises sequence-similar fold switchers,
                 whose secondary structures shift from α-helix β-sheet through a
                 small number of mutations, a sequence insertion, or a deletion.
                 Predictive methods for identifying sequence-similar fold
                 switchers are desirable because some are associated with
                 disease and/or can perform different functions in cells. Here,
                 we use homology-based secondary structure predictions to
                 identify sequence-similar fold switchers from their amino acid
                 sequences alone. To do this, we predicted the secondary
                 structures of sequence-similar fold switchers using three
                 different homology-based secondary structure predictors:
                 PSIPRED, JPred4, and SPIDER3. We found that α-helix β-strand
                 prediction discrepancies from JPred4 discriminated between the
                 different conformations of sequence-similar fold switchers with
                 high statistical significance (P < 1.8*10-19 ). Thus, we used
                 these discrepancies as a classifier and found that they can
                 often robustly discriminate between sequence-similar fold
                 switchers and sequence-similar proteins that maintain the same
                 folds (Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.82). We found that
                 JPred4 is a more robust predictor of sequence-similar fold
                 switchers because of (a) the curated sequence database it uses
                 to produce multiple sequence alignments and (b) its use of
                 sequence profiles based on Hidden Markov Models. Our results
                 indicate that inconsistencies between JPred4 secondary
                 structure predictions can be used to identify some
                 sequence-similar fold switchers from their sequences alone.
                 Thus, the negative information from inconsistent secondary
                 structure predictions can potentially be leveraged to identify

                 stimuli, regulating biological processes and affecting human
                 health. Despite their biological importance, these proteins
                 remain understudied. Predictive methods are needed to expedite
                 the process of discovering and characterizing more of these
                 shapeshifting proteins. Most previous approaches require a
                 solved structure or all-atom simulations, greatly constraining
                 their use. Here, we propose a high-throughput sequence-based
                 method for predicting extant fold switchers that transition
                 from α-helix in one conformation to β-strand in the other. This
                 method leverages two previous observations: (a) α-helix ↔
                 β-strand prediction discrepancies from JPred4 are a robust
                 predictor of fold switching, and (b) the fold-switching regions
                 (FSRs) of some extant fold switchers have different secondary
                 structure propensities when expressed by themselves (isolated
                 FSRs) than when expressed within the context of their parent
                 protein (contextualized FSRs). Combining these two
                 observations, we ran JPred4 on 99-fold-switching proteins and
                 found strong correspondence between predicted and
                 experimentally observed α-helix ↔ β-strand discrepancies. To
                 test the overall robustness of this finding, we randomly
                 selected regions of proteins not expected to switch folds
                 (single-fold proteins) and found significantly fewer predicted
                 α-helix ↔ β-strand discrepancies. Combining these discrepancies
                 with the overall percentage of predicted secondary structure,
                 we developed a classifier to identify extant fold switchers
                 (Matthews correlation coefficient of .71). Although this
                 classifier had a high false-negative rate (7/17), its
                 false-positive rate was very low (2/136), suggesting that it

                 this assumption, though it has recently been challenged by ~100
                 fold-switching proteins. Though ostensibly rare, these proteins
                 raise the question of how many uncharacterized proteins have
                 shapeshifting-rather than fixed-secondary structures. Here, we

                 switching in the universally conserved NusG transcription
                 factor family, one member of which has a 50-residue regulatory

                 disability (DD/ID) are extremely rare, and robust discovery of
                 these requires both large-scale DNA sequencing and data
                 sharing. Here we describe a GeneMatcher collaboration which led
                 to a cohort of 13 affected individuals harboring
                 protein-altering variants, 11 of which are de novo, in MED13;
                 the only inherited variant was transmitted to an affected child
                 from an affected mother. All patients had intellectual
                 disability and/or developmental delays, including speech delays
                 or disorders. Other features that were reported in two or more
                 patients include autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit
                 hyperactivity disorder, optic nerve abnormalities, Duane
                 anomaly, hypotonia, mild congenital heart abnormalities, and
                 dysmorphisms. Six affected individuals had mutations that are
                 predicted to truncate the MED13 protein, six had missense
                 mutations, and one had an in-frame-deletion of one amino acid.
                 Out of the seven non-truncating mutations, six clustered in two
                 specific locations of the MED13 protein: an N-terminal and
                 C-terminal region. The four N-terminal clustering mutations
                 affect two adjacent amino acids that are known to be involved
                 in MED13 ubiquitination and degradation, p.Thr326 and p.Pro327.
                 MED13 is a component of the CDK8-kinase module that can
                 reversibly bind Mediator, a multi-protein complex that is
                 required for Polymerase II transcription initiation. Mutations
                 in several other genes encoding subunits of Mediator have been
                 previously shown to associate with DD/ID, including MED13L, a

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Central to protein biology is the understanding of
                 how structural elements give rise to observed function. The
                 surfeit of protein structural data enables development of
                 computational methods to systematically derive rules governing
                 structural-functional relationships. However, performance of
                 these methods depends critically on the choice of protein
                 structural representation. Most current methods rely on
                 features that are manually selected based on knowledge about
                 protein structures. These are often general-purpose but not
                 optimized for the specific application of interest. In this
                 paper, we present a general framework that applies 3D
                 convolutional neural network (3DCNN) technology to
                 structure-based protein analysis. The framework automatically
                 extracts task-specific features from the raw atom distribution,
                 driven by supervised labels. As a pilot study, we use our
                 network to analyze local protein microenvironments surrounding
                 the 20 amino acids, and predict the amino acids most compatible
                 with environments within a protein structure. To further
                 validate the power of our method, we construct two amino acid
                 substitution matrices from the prediction statistics and use
                 them to predict effects of mutations in T4 lysozyme structures.
                 RESULTS: Our deep 3DCNN achieves a two-fold increase in
                 prediction accuracy compared to models that employ conventional
                 hand-engineered features and successfully recapitulates known
                 information about similar and different microenvironments.
                 Models built from our predictions and substitution matrices
                 achieve an 85\% accuracy predicting outcomes of the T4 lysozyme
                 mutation variants. Our substitution matrices contain rich
                 information relevant to mutation analysis compared to
                 well-established substitution matrices. Finally, we present a
                 visualization method to inspect the individual contributions of
                 each atom to the classification decisions. CONCLUSIONS:
                 End-to-end trained deep learning networks consistently
                 outperform methods using hand-engineered features, suggesting
                 that the 3DCNN framework is well suited for analysis of protein
                 microenvironments and may be useful for other protein
                 structural analyses.",

                 been dramatically improved with the help of advances in deep
                 learning. In the recent CASP14, Deepmind demonstrated that
                 their new version of AlphaFold (AF) produces highly accurate 3D
                 models almost close to experimental structures. The success of
                 AF shows that the multiple sequence alignment of a sequence
                 contains rich evolutionary information, leading to accurate 3D
                 models. Despite the success of AF, only the prediction code is
                 open, and training a similar model requires a vast amount of
                 computational resources. Thus, developing a lighter prediction
                 model is still necessary. RESULTS: In this study, we propose a
                 new protein 3D structure modeling method, A-Prot, using MSA
                 Transformer, one of the state-of-the-art protein language
                 models. An MSA feature tensor and row attention maps are
                 extracted and converted into 2D residue-residue distance and
                 dihedral angle predictions for a given MSA. We demonstrated
                 that A-Prot predicts long-range contacts better than the
                 existing methods. Additionally, we modeled the 3D structures of
                 the free modeling and hard template-based modeling targets of
                 CASP14. The assessment shows that the A-Prot models are more
                 accurate than most top server groups of CASP14. CONCLUSION:
                 These results imply that A-Prot accurately captures the
                 evolutionary and structural information of proteins with
                 relatively low computational cost. Thus, A-Prot can provide a
                 clue for the development of other protein property prediction

                 we lack a general theory of how proteins evolve high
                 specificity. Here, we present such a model that combines
                 chemistry, mechanics, and genetics and explains how their
                 interplay governs the evolution of specific protein-ligand
                 interactions. The model shows that there are many routes to
                 achieving molecular discrimination-by varying degrees of
                 flexibility and shape/chemistry complementarity-but the key
                 ingredient is precision. Harder discrimination tasks require
                 more collective and precise coaction of structure, forces, and
                 movements. Proteins can achieve this through correlated
                 mutations extending far from a binding site, which fine-tune
                 the localized interaction with the ligand. Thus, the solution
                 of more complicated tasks is enabled by increasing the protein
                 size, and proteins become more evolvable and robust when they
                 are larger than the bare minimum required for discrimination.
                 The model makes testable, specific predictions about the role
                 of flexibility and shape mismatch in discrimination, and how
                 evolution can independently tune affinity and specificity.
                 Thus, the proposed theory of specific binding addresses the
                 natural question of ``why are proteins so big?''. A possible
                 answer is that molecular discrimination is often a hard task
                 best performed by adding more layers to the protein.",

                 arranged in parallel dimers, at 2.9 Å resolution. The structure

  abstract    = "Opioids represent widely prescribed and abused medications,
                 although their signal transduction mechanisms are not well
                 understood. Here we present the 1.8 Å high-resolution crystal
                 structure of the human δ-opioid receptor (δ-OR), revealing the
                 presence and fundamental role of a sodium ion in mediating
                 allosteric control of receptor functional selectivity and
                 constitutive activity. The distinctive δ-OR sodium ion site
                 architecture is centrally located in a polar interaction
                 network in the seven-transmembrane bundle core, with the sodium
                 ion stabilizing a reduced agonist affinity state, and thereby
                 modulating signal transduction. Site-directed mutagenesis and
                 functional studies reveal that changing the allosteric sodium
                 site residue Asn 131 to an alanine or a valine augments
                 constitutive β-arrestin-mediated signalling. Asp95Ala,

                 agonists. The data establish the molecular basis for allosteric
                 sodium ion control in opioid signalling, revealing that

  abstract    = "Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a family of
                 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are irreversibly
                 activated by proteolytic cleavage of the N terminus, which
                 unmasks a tethered peptide ligand that binds and activates the
                 transmembrane receptor domain, eliciting a cellular cascade in
                 response to inflammatory signals and other stimuli. PARs are
                 implicated in a wide range of diseases, such as cancer and
                 inflammation. PARs have been the subject of major
                 pharmaceutical research efforts but the discovery of
                 small-molecule antagonists that effectively bind them has
                 proved challenging. The only marketed drug targeting a PAR is
                 vorapaxar, a selective antagonist of PAR1 used to prevent
                 thrombosis. The structure of PAR1 in complex with vorapaxar has
                 been reported previously. Despite sequence homology across the
                 PAR isoforms, discovery of PAR2 antagonists has been less
                 successful, although GB88 has been described as a weak
                 antagonist. Here we report crystal structures of PAR2 in
                 complex with two distinct antagonists and a blocking antibody.
                 The antagonist AZ8838 binds in a fully occluded pocket near the
                 extracellular surface. Functional and binding studies reveal
                 that AZ8838 exhibits slow binding kinetics, which is an
                 attractive feature for a PAR2 antagonist competing against a
                 tethered ligand. Antagonist AZ3451 binds to a remote allosteric
                 site outside the helical bundle. We propose that antagonist
                 binding prevents structural rearrangements required for
                 receptor activation and signalling. We also show that a
                 blocking antibody antigen-binding fragment binds to the
                 extracellular surface of PAR2, preventing access of the
                 tethered ligand to the peptide-binding site. These structures
                 provide a basis for the development of selective PAR2
                 antagonists for a range of therapeutic uses.",

                 because of the potential life-threatening character of the
                 disease, the potential cardiovascular effects of compensatory
                 aldosterone excess, and the role of the mineralocorticoid
                 system in human hypertension. We present the first
                 comprehensive study seeking nucleotide substitutions in coding
                 regions, intron-exon junctions, and untranslated exons, as well
                 as for large deletions. A total of 22 MR gene abnormalities
                 were found in 33 patients. We demonstrate that MR mutations are
                 extremely frequent in PHA1 patients classified according to
                 aldosterone and potassium levels and give indications for
                 accurate clinical and biological investigation. In our study
                 the possibility of a genocopy exists in three PHA1 kindreds.
                 The other patients without MR mutations might have different
                 diseases resembling to PHA1 in the neonatal period, which could
                 be identified by extensive clinical and functional exploration.",

                 Goldmann-Favre syndrome (GFS), and clumped pigmentary retinal
                 degeneration (CPRD) are caused by mutations in the NR2E3 gene
                 and to characterize the clinical findings in patients with
                 NR2E3 mutations. Patients One patient with ESCS, one with GFS,
                 and 20 with CPRD. METHODS: The coding regions of the NR2E3 and
                 NRL genes and part of the THRB1 coding region were scanned for
                 mutations using single-strand conformation and direct
                 sequencing methods. We evaluated visual acuity, refractive
                 error, visual fields, fundi, final dark-adaptation thresholds,
                 and electroretinograms (ERGs). RESULTS: The patients with ESCS
                 and GFS and 9 of the 20 unrelated patients with CPRD had
                 mutations in the NR2E3 gene. Six mutations were found in these
                 11 patients, including 2 novel mutations: the missense mutation
                 Ala256Glu and the frameshift mutation Pro276del17 (the first
                 obviously null allele reported). Three patients were mutant
                 homozygotes, and 8 had 2 mutations. All but one of the
                 mutations in the patients with ESCS and GFS were also found in
                 patients with CPRD. All NR2E3 cases were hyperopes and had
                 retinal vascular attenuation and reduced and delayed full-field
                 ERGs. Clumped pigment deposits were recognized in the patients
                 with ESCS and GFS. The CPRD patients without NR2E3 mutations
                 had no detected mutations in NRL or THRB1. CONCLUSIONS: We
                 found that ESCS, GFS, and CPRD can all have the same genetic
                 basis. Clinical Relevance The combination of night blindness,
                 hyperopia, and clumped retinal pigment deposits should raise
                 the suspicion that a patient has NR2E3 disease.",

                 of the NRL protein. Loss-of-function NRL alleles have not been
                 described previously in humans, but since the same mutation was
                 present in unaffected family members, it raises the possibility
                 that the abnormal ESCS phenotype in Patient A may result from a
                 digenic mechanism, with a heterozygous NRL mutation and a

                 sexual differentiation caused by mutations in the androgen
                 receptor (AR) gene. The partial form (PAIS), associated with
                 varying degrees of receptor dysfunction, presents with a range
                 of undervirilization phenotypes. The complete form (CAIS) is
                 characterized by normal female external appearance at birth. In
                 these cases the receptor is often absent or inactive. However,
                 cases have been described where the mutant receptor concerned
                 has considerable residual activity in in vitro assays. Here we
                 describe the effects of five mutations, Gly750Asp, Leu762Phe,
                 Ala765Thr, Asp864Asn and Leu907Phe, identified in complete
                 androgen insensitivity patients. In vitro assays of mutant
                 androgen receptors expressed in a mammalian cell line showed
                 that the Gly750Asp, Leu762Phe and Ala765Thr mutations cause
                 almost complete loss of androgen-binding activity, suggesting
                 that these residues are critical for ligand binding. However,
                 receptors with Asp864Asn and Leu907Phe, although defective,
                 were capable of considerable binding and transactivation
                 activity. Given that some mutations identified in PAIS patients
                 have a more severe effect on androgen receptor function than
                 two CAIS mutations described here, these results provide
                 further evidence that other factors, including genetic
                 background, can have a significant impact on the phenotype
                 associated with a particular AR mutation.",

                 side effects due to non-selective binding to other aminergic
                 receptors. Here, we report the structures of human 5-HT2AR in
                 complex with the second-generation antipsychotics risperidone

                 5-HT2AR is structurally similar to 5-HT2CR but possesses a
                 unique side-extended cavity near the orthosteric binding site.
                 A docking study and mutagenic studies suggest that a highly

                 not understood, although activation of the 5-HT2A serotonin
                 receptor (HTR2A) is key. To gain molecular insights into
                 psychedelic actions, we determined the active-state structure
                 of HTR2A bound to 25-CN-NBOH-a prototypical hallucinogen-in
                 complex with an engineered Gαq heterotrimer by cryoelectron
                 microscopy (cryo-EM). We also obtained the X-ray crystal
                 structures of HTR2A complexed with the arrestin-biased ligand
                 LSD or the inverse agonist methiothepin. Comparisons of these
                 structures reveal determinants responsible for HTR2A-Gαq
                 protein interactions as well as the conformational
                 rearrangements involved in active-state transitions. Given the
                 potential therapeutic actions of hallucinogens, these findings
                 could accelerate the discovery of more selective drugs for the
                 treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

  abstract    = "A long-standing biological question is how evolution has shaped
                 the genomic architecture of dikaryotic fungi. To answer this,
                 high-quality genomic resources that enable haplotype
                 comparisons are essential. Short-read genome assemblies for
                 dikaryotic fungi are highly fragmented and lack
                 haplotype-specific information due to the high heterozygosity
                 and repeat content of these genomes. Here, we present a
                 diploid-aware assembly of the wheat stripe rust fungus Puccinia
                 striiformis f. sp. tritici based on long reads using the
                 FALCON-Unzip assembler. Transcriptome sequencing data sets were
                 used to infer high-quality gene models and identify virulence
                 genes involved in plant infection referred to as effectors.
                 This represents the most complete Puccinia striiformis f. sp.
                 tritici genome assembly to date (83 Mb, 156 contigs, N50 of 1.5
                 Mb) and provides phased haplotype information for over 92\% of
                 the genome. Comparisons of the phase blocks revealed high
                 interhaplotype diversity of over 6\%. More than 25\% of all
                 genes lack a clear allelic counterpart. When we investigated
                 genome features that potentially promote the rapid evolution of
                 virulence, we found that candidate effector genes are spatially
                 associated with conserved genes commonly found in
                 basidiomycetes. Yet, candidate effectors that lack an allelic
                 counterpart are more distant from conserved genes than allelic
                 candidate effectors and are less likely to be evolutionarily
                 conserved within the P. striiformis species complex and
                 Pucciniales In summary, this haplotype-phased assembly enabled
                 us to discover novel genome features of a dikaryotic
                 plant-pathogenic fungus previously hidden in collapsed and
                 fragmented genome assemblies.IMPORTANCE Current representations
                 of eukaryotic microbial genomes are haploid, hiding the genomic
                 diversity intrinsic to diploid and polyploid life forms. This
                 hidden diversity contributes to the organism's evolutionary
                 potential and ability to adapt to stress conditions. Yet, it is
                 challenging to provide haplotype-specific information at a
                 whole-genome level. Here, we take advantage of long-read DNA
                 sequencing technology and a tailored-assembly algorithm to
                 disentangle the two haploid genomes of a dikaryotic pathogenic
                 wheat rust fungus. The two genomes display high levels of
                 nucleotide and structural variations, which lead to allelic
                 variation and the presence of genes lacking allelic
                 counterparts. Nonallelic candidate effector genes, which likely

  abstract = "Enzymes catalyze the reactions of life and are the targets of most
              small molecule drugs. Most drugs target conserved enzyme active
              sites, often causing problems of specificity and toxicity.
              Targeting allosteric sites can increase specificity, overcome
              resistance mutations, and allow fine-tuning of activity. However,
              most enzymes have no known allosteric sites and methods do not
              exist to comprehensively identify them. Here we present a general
              and fast approach to chart allosteric communication in enzymes and
              apply it to the Src kinase to produce the first comprehensive map
              of negative and positive allosteric control of an enzymatic
              activity. Allostery in the Src kinase domain is pervasive,
              anisotropic, partially predictable, and modulated by regulatory
              domains. Multiple surface pockets of Src are allosterically active
              and so genetically-prioritized for the development of inhibitory
              and activating drugs. Using this approach it should be possible to
              chart global allosteric maps of many kinases and other enzymes
              important for medicine and biotechnology.",

                 exploited to predict structure and other features. Similar
                 constraints should affect variation across individuals, but it
                 is only with the growth of human population sequencing that
                 this has been tested at scale. Now, human population constraint
                 has established applications in pathogenicity prediction, but
                 it has not yet been explored for structural inference. Here, we
                 map 2.4 million population variants to 5885 protein families
                 and quantify residue-level constraint with a new Missense
                 Enrichment Score (MES). Analysis of 61,214 structures from the
                 PDB spanning 3661 families shows that missense depleted sites
                 are enriched in buried residues or those involved in
                 small-molecule or protein binding. MES is complementary to
                 evolutionary conservation and a combined analysis allows a new
                 classification of residues according to a conservation plane.
                 This approach finds functional residues that are evolutionarily
                 diverse, which can be related to specificity, as well as
                 family-wide conserved sites that are critical for folding or
                 function. We also find a possible contrast between lethal and
                 non-lethal pathogenic sites, and a surprising clinical variant
                 hot spot at a subset of missense enriched positions.",

  abstract    = "New and improved drugs are required for the treatment and
                 ultimate eradication of malaria. The efficacy of front-line
                 therapies is now threatened by emerging drug resistance; thus,
                 new tools to support the development of drugs with a lower
                 propensity for resistance are needed. Here, we describe the
                 development of a RESistance Mapping And Profiling (ResMAP)
                 platform for the identification of resistance-conferring
                 mutations in Plasmodium drug targets. Proof-of-concept studies
                 focused on interrogating the antimalarial drug target,
                 Plasmodium falciparum lysyl tRNA synthetase (PfKRS). Saturation
                 mutagenesis was used to construct a plasmid library encoding
                 all conceivable mutations within a 20-residue span at the base
                 of the PfKRS ATP-binding pocket. The superior transfection
                 efficiency of Plasmodium knowlesi was exploited to generate a
                 high coverage parasite library expressing PfKRS bearing all
                 possible amino acid changes within this region of the enzyme.
                 The selection of the library with PfKRS inhibitors, cladosporin
                 and DDD01510706, successfully identified multiple
                 resistance-conferring substitutions. Genetic validation of a
                 subset of these mutations confirmed their direct role in
                 resistance, with computational modeling used to dissect the
                 structural basis of resistance. The application of ResMAP to
                 inform the development of resistance-resilient antimalarials of
                 the future is discussed. IMPORTANCE: An increase in treatment
                 failures for malaria highlights an urgent need for new tools to
                 understand and minimize the spread of drug resistance. We
                 describe the development of a RESistance Mapping And Profiling
                 (ResMAP) platform for the identification of
                 resistance-conferring mutations in Plasmodium spp, the
                 causative agent of malaria. Saturation mutagenesis was used to
                 generate a mutation library containing all conceivable
                 mutations for a region of the antimalarial-binding site of a
                 promising drug target, Plasmodium falciparum lysyl tRNA
                 synthetase (PfKRS). Screening of this high-coverage library
                 with characterized PfKRS inhibitors revealed multiple
                 resistance-conferring substitutions including several
                 clinically relevant mutations. Genetic validation of these
                 mutations confirmed resistance of up to 100-fold and
                 computational modeling dissected their role in drug resistance.
                 We discuss potential applications of this data including the
                 potential to design compounds that can bypass the most serious
                 resistance mutations and future resistance surveillance.",
